It was like being at the fence of the garden of Eden, looking in at happy Googlers, while sitting just out of reach. Being a Google employee, a ""white badger"", is great. Being a contractor (or TVC as Google calls us) can range from honestly very great, to terrible. If you're a developer who is a contractor, or a manager, life is pretty good. But if you're a worker bee, it's rough. The maps people possibly have the worst of it.

The Google divide is becomes quickly, starkly obvious just after starting. There is no health insurance, and no paid time off when working as a Google Maps surveyor (or any TVC). Traveling extensively, often no where interesting, and staying over the weekend with no option to return home for weeks at a time made this job very hard for me, especially because I have a family. Vacations, even short ones, where highly detrimental to putting food on the table and paying rent.

Google gave me a corporate credit card to pay for daily meals, which was good. BUT the card was heavily micromanaged with daily and weekly reports due for its use. Even though it had a daily expenditure cap. But I was never allowed to gain points for purchases, while my managers quickly become diamond Hilton members making reservations for me...

That's fine for him, but it's likely that all his employees in that department were laid off. It's also likely that they were low-paid contractors.

The workplace culture in my store was very positive overall. I felt as though we were a very close-knit family, a very well-oiled machine. There was virtually none of the typical ""gossip"" you'd find at other companies, and almost everyone got along with everyone else. Store meetings were very fun and very positive, not boring.

I have moved into a role where I often get to mentor new advisors and help them hone both their technical and customer-facing skills. The pay is good for a ""call center"" job but is still not that great. Pay increases are rare and small and only do enough to keep up with cost of living increases. I was offered to move up to a Senior advisor but the pay increase was less than 5%, which is not much at all when you are only making $38k/year before taxes. This would be a great job for a stay-at-home parent or someone that really does not want to commute to work every day. After two years I have really missed being in a traditional workplace.

Apple does offer VERY good benefits and employee discounts. They also have 401k and employee stock purchasing programs but they hard to really use as your base pay with AppleCare is not very high.

As with any call center job it can be difficult to deal with other people's issues all day. Most customer's are great and have relatively simple questions about their Apple products or Apple IDs. That being said, it is far too often when you are forced to sit idly as a customer yells at you for something that they did to their device.

AppleCare is also open 364 days out of the year and is only closed on New Years day. This will create situations where you will miss-out on holidays with your family.

Cons
Micromanagement to the point of irritation. Managers who are not knowledgeable. Constant rude customers who swear, demean, and yell at you on almost every call. Dealing with customer who have valid reasons for being upset due to subpar products and software, and having to pretend that the customer is wrong.
Shift bids every 2 months which are based on CSATs and other unattainable metrics. Working with contract employees who have had little to no training. Not allowing customers to access their own information due to some false sense of security. I would not recommend this job to anyone who wants to have work-life balance, pride in the company they work for, a support team, or a sense of self-respect at the end of the day. I am in the Pre-management program and cannot wait to change things at Apple for the better.

If you have a good attitude, you don't minds working hard, you understand people can be mean or grumpy anywhere at anytime and are willing to take that on occasion, then you'll do great. The weekends and busy time around holidays get old, but the benefits really make up for it. The benefits are amazing. They are so comfortable that it makes it hard to leave when it's time to leave. Promotion is also extremely competitive and always takes way longer than you hope or imagine it would. Stick it out, and you'll eventually get it in many cases, but it might take serious tenacity and time. There are some exceptions, but they are rare.

Development is a commitment by leaders. Sometimes it is not as good as other times. Some leaders are better at it that others, but it is a part of the culture, which is great. If you're self motivated and take ownership, you'll develop and grow. If you think your development is someone else's job, you will be frustrated on occasion.

Learn as much as you can at work, there is so much to learn! Then take you benefits and go learn at school or elsewhere. So many people don't use their benefits in education. It's free money people, even if you can only spend it by studying and learning, it's worth it.

If you don't like people and your skin is not too thick. Go do something else. Otherwise, it's a pretty fun gig, but it's not designed to be permanent for most people. Always be making 2 plans - development for internal promotion and development for external opportunities.

Customers and your personality can make this a good job or a bad job. If you are an introvert, this is obviously not the job for you. Also, have patience. There are a lot of elderly people calling and some of them will make your life easy. Some of them won't.

Like any job, there will be regular performance reviews with actually constructive criticism and improvement strategies discussed.

Hardest part of the job was staying motivated throughout the day while providing great and consistent customer service...2nd hardest part is actually not being able to see the devices/software (in some cases you will be able to see the software) while you're troubleshooting.

The culture is great and you feel like the people around you care for you. I went further into the technical side of Apple by going in to the family room. I started by talking to people about their issues with their iOS devices. I switch markets when I moved to Colorado Springs, CO. The culture changes from different markets primarily due to store volume. The small the store the closer you feel to the people you work with. The larger the more overwhelming in can be. I moved back to Austin, TX and became a genius. The new store I'm in is different than Colorado because its more volume but we still kept our culture. It gets hard dealing with multiple personalities of customers and some entitlement but management helps you with your day to day. My co workers keep me sane and really make my day. All of the benefits we have, ranging from health to simple discounts really make it worth wild. The pay is great and you feel good when you receive your check and go out with the people you work with. Overall I would give Apple a big up because it keeps you interested and opportunities are always there. I feel like the only draw is the larger the company gets the inevitable happens, it will feel like big box retail. Get to know your people and you will always enjoy what you do.

Never in my career have I worked with such a close knit group of people and even after 3 years of employment elsewhere I can still say that the employees I met from working at Apple are still some of my closest friends. You'll learn a lot here about technology and how to best help people, and from the store I worked at it was pretty easy to become a jack-of-all-trades (I was primarily in Sales, but was able to learn how to fix mobile devices and help when needed).

Be aware, this is NOT a company you can work for and sit around and do nothing at. You'll almost always be busy helping someone, cleaning the store, straightening up products, and so many other options. But the days go by fast and you'll be genuinely happy to come back in for your next shift.

Apple has taken a lot of missteps since I've left. There are many employees that should have been promoted to managers (leader turnover was high at the store I worked at), but Apple insisted on hiring externally, which I don't believe was fair when you have plenty of hard working, proven, and qualified individuals that deserve that position more than an external hire. They weren't (and from what I know, still haven't) been given a chance to interview for the many management positions that have continually appeared because of the turnover rate.

That said, Apple mitigates that by adding in several different benefits such as working from home, very generous sick and leave benefits (you never have to hope and pray someones approves your vacation request; if the time is available, you can have it), and of course great discounts on Apple products.

That said, if you are used to working at an in-person helpdesk, working from home in a call center environment can be a major drawback. There is almost no downtime or slow times, so if being on the phone for 8-10 hours in a row is a downside, this isn't for you. The schedule changes every 3 months, with people who have the best metrics getting their top pick from a predetermined list of choices there- often times those same metrics are well out of an Advisor's control as well so not a lot can always be done with that. There are also a lot of repetitive problems, which for a person like myself can make the job very tiring to do- no new challenges or anything to solve, just get the call and follow the procedures in a help article.

On the bright side, if you can stick it out long enough, you can advance to a multitude of different positions but many people won't get that far because so many people are still needed in basic support and not a lot of positions are open, and they may go to people who've been waiting even longer.

These surveys could be completely false, and your manager could review the call/case and determine that you indeed did your job as required/expected or even beyond company expectations, but if the customer left a bad survey it affects your stats, period. These stats play a factor in which shifts you're able to get. Schedules change every three months and you only learn your next 3 month schedule one month before it starts. The only individuals allowed to chose the schedule of their liking are those who score in the top 5%. The rest of the employees get placed into three pools, and your stats affect your place within your pool. If your in the current pool that gets first pick, and you performed above expectation, you might get a shift you like, might. However, these pools rotate themselves, between who gets to select first, second and third. So, every nine months, unless you place within the top 5% of all advisors, your pool will be the last to get to pick your schedule, meaning you then compete with those within your pool for the shifts that no one else wanted. Typically the shifts that have you working very late, or on both weekend days.

However, as a contractor, I have no paid holidays, no PTO, and only 3 sick days for the entire year, and that was not the case when I had started. This particularly becomes a problem in calendar Q4 when Tim is generous to the employees w/ holidays, but I have no way to compensate for the lack of pay during Thanksgiving week and the Christmas-New Years shut down. The other issue is the 15-18 month limit on contractors, so if you aren't converted after that, you have to leave for a few months before you can come back, which is not practical. Lastly, as a contractor, I feel like a second class citizen in the company -- there are many moments when it becomes painfully obvious you are not a regular employee.

Aside from those sticking points, I think the company culture is great, the regular employees seem to have great benefits, and it is genuinely a diverse workplace -- at least in my building, I have bumped into all sorts of nationalities, ethnicities, religions, orientations, persons with disabilities, etc...

The dedication that people have to Apples products is legendary and supporting these people has always been a supreme joy. The management style at Apple is its worst problem. The culture of threatening its employees and providing zero encouragement and guidance and support in areas that truly matter is saddening. The company is such a huge monster and has the potential to be even bigger and better if only it would treat its employees with more respect and treat them as humans, not just numbers. The managers are expected to deliver coaching opportunities in every meeting, never being given an opportunity to simply praise a employee and nothing else. I have seen so many times when managers are on completely opposite ends of communication and ideas for managing and the confusion this causes with the employees is frightening. The company itself is a good company that offered good compensation and benefits, however the management styles that encourage and expect threatening and intimidation as a way to motivate employees is misguided and wrong on all levels.

The only negatives about this job are the work life balance. We switch schedules every 90 days and what schedule you get is based on your metrics while on the phone with customers. They give you options on schedule but you are pretty much guaranteed to work at least one weekend day. In addition, when November and December come around we get busy. This means you will most likely be working Thanksgiving and/or Christmas. You also can not take time off during those months without a head manager approval. Now to be fair they give you 3 days to make up for the holidays that you can use but the hours have to be available for you to take them.

A typical day at work involves checking various forms of communication about any information that might be coming down the pipeline, connecting with your peers and friends, and performing whatever task you are assigned to for the day. That might be selling, managing appointments, or helping teach new customers about their product.

As you become more experienced in the store, or partner with a Leader to express interest, you may be developed to assist with technical support on iOS devices. At that point, your day would consist of managing appointments for the technical side of things (Genius Bar), or taking appointments for Mobile devices.

These experiences can lead to becoming a Genius (Mac Hardware/Software certifications), a Leader (management experience opportunities, leading different areas of the store), performing visual management (set up new products on display, organize the store, etc), or managing inventory and bring products to our peers for sales. We even have business opportunities to teach employees how to assist small/medium business with their tech needs and opportunities that Apple might assist with.

I'm mainly referencing the GYOG program (grow your own genius) which is designed to teach you how to preform the duties of a genius. The way this is used in my store is to have higher quality technicians trained as geniuses to pay them less. Communication is abysmal, policies change which we are not told about, and then we have multiple meeting about it. It's just like Office Space, I have seven different bosses. Plus I have three secret bosses (people on experiences). I have to work in a box, I'm very limited in what I can do.

The hugest down side for me was the inability to achieve any hope of work life balance working on the graveyard shift. Certain mandatory meetings are held during hours when someone who is on an opposite schedule should be sleeping. Moreover, with the lack of sleep being a huge factor in performance, hard to keep up with volatile changes in team dynamics while being expected to perform with consistency.

They say you if you provide these excellent metric numbers you can have whatever schedule you want but trying to get it may prove to be an impossible task. Your call score or metrics are also based around the very same people you take calls from. Imagine helping someone who's been on the phone for an hour only to fix their problem, you bid them farewell and move on only to have them still give you a low score but not based on the work you did but the customers outlook on apple.

Call time is also important but most of the time it ends up running over because more often then not you get a customer who's call can easily last 25-30 mins or more.

My normal day as chat advisor starts with me logging in to the computer apple sent me 5 minutes before the shift so i can check email and get prepared for work.

As soon as your shift starts you will get busy. In chat we are expected to answer two chats at the same time. Each chat is expected to be resolved in 25 minutes or less. If the customer needs screen sharing we also do that.

In these 25 minutes you have to defuse the customer, assure, and provide support by troubleshooting or providing the appropriate response.

You will have to log all the interaction, case notes, followups, send emails to customers,

In this position you will not get holidays off, you will get them paid as holiday pay and overtime. So that's nice, however you can't be with your family cause it's super busy.

Schedules are according to your performance, what defines your performance is customer's feedback or surveys. Picture a very angry customer who just lost all his contacts in iCloud and you can't recover them. Or someone that purchased a stolen iPhone and can't activate it. Those customers will give you a bad survey based on their feelings about the company. This will affect your metrics and schedules.

If you're a super good advisor, you will get 1 weekend day off. They have 4days x10hrs or 5days x8hours schedules.

They mostly hire very tech savvy people who have a vast background in troubleshooting, customer service, and knowledge of products similar to what Apple sells.

The most challenging part of the job is the constant flood of customers, one after the other (referred to as back-to-back calls) who almost always start the call frustrated and sometimes even irate. Understandably, they're calling us because their very expensive Apple product is malfunctioning in some way, or they've become frustrated trying to get a specific function or feature to work.

The people who work here are the absolute best at what they do. They are all passionate and motivated, and their only goal is to provide an excellent customer experience and show the customers what they can do with our technology in their lives.

Management is engaged with employees for the most part, there are times where an associate needs a manager and there are none to be found. Management is committed to employee development, and is interested in learning about us even when we are not at the office.

One of the tougher parts of the job is just keeping pace with the amount of people walking through our doors on a daily basis. We are expected to be able to help every customer in a timely manner, regardless of circumstances. The reason this is challenging is due to the fact that we oftentimes do not have the manpower to handle the amount of traffic we see come in.

The most enjoyable part of this job is by far the people you work with. These are some of the most passionate and dedicated individuals a person will ever work with.

Unfortunately, I quickly learned that Apple is not a place to start a career, when there is so much corruption when it comes to advancing. This place relies on sucking up to management to advance, there is no professional atmosphere. I seen and heard many unprofessional conduct from managers getting away with switching out their beaten products with new ones to managers harassing other employees. I find it disgusting that a place that strives for equality in a workplace is so discriminating to employees when they want to advance, if you want to pursue any career in apple, you quickly learn it's whose butt you can kiss and that managers are useless and do what they want; there is no supportive structure, the managers will gang up you, if you speak out against them. They will put their favorites in newly opened positions, while employees that been working their butt off for years are left in the dust. Coworkers can not be trusted, they will smile with you then go behind your back to management to tell them lies so they can get the heads up to the newly opened positions. The only reason I'm still there is it's difficult to find work.

New schedules come out every 3-4 months and are based on your metrics including customer reviews, average call time, time between calls, etc. I always had great reviews except when calls would be transferred to me from other departments. When customers are juggled around they don't forget it, even if you resolve their issues and they are satisfied with you they tend to leave you a bad review but complain about the other people that assisted them during the call. This WILL impact your work schedule and reviews by management. Other advisors find a way to upset the customers and then it falls on you to take the blame and hit on the review when the call is dropped in your lap through a blind transfer.

Your work hours can be any day of the week and between any of their business hours. This makes it extremely hard to plan things in your life. During the holidays and during new product releases you can forget about having a life. They require you to work mandatory overtime, period. Sometimes, like when they release new products and there isn't a fixed release date, they'll just spring mandatory overtime on you and may require you to work on your off days with no notice.

This is one of the most sought after companies to work for and there is good reason: Apple understands vision more than most.

Apple retail does not feel like typical retail. The only thing that feels remotely retail is the schedule. The schedule does not meet my definition of work/life balance. I enjoy the work tremendously including the people I work with. If you are considering Apple retail, understand what you are signing up for. There are NO set days off--it's retail. If you accept this, then you will be fine. If your gut tells you otherwise, then pursue something else.

There is no typical day at work. Everyday is different. There are consistent responsibilities, but within each responsibility there arises new problems that force me to exercise skills that I don't normally use outside of work. I am extremely thankful of the experience.

One of the most rewarding parts of the job is working with incredible talent. Apple pride's itself with hiring the best. This is generally true. Not only have I worked with incredibly talented and smart people, I can honestly say that I have made some lifelong friends. Apple lends itself to making great friends and professional partners.

The good thing is you'll never sit around with nothing to do. This does mean you'll have to be good with handling lots of customers quickly without making them upset, so it can be stressful at times, but management understands this and will help provide tools to help you handle your responsibilities.

Your shifts are scheduled fairly with due notice (usually a week and a half). Showing up late is the quickest way to lose your job, though there is a process for this that is clear and reasonable. Breaks are scheduled as well. The tasks scheduled out for you depend on your job, and there is lots of opportunity to try a different role within the store if you find you may not enjoy what you're doing day-to-day.

Management will schedule time to talk with you if you want it. Reviews are done annually. Daily meetings are common to share positive experiences and talk about where the store can improve. Most employees honestly feel they sell quality products and that they are doing good by their customers.

The techniques, from upper management down to entry level, are fantastically efficient and effective. It is very inspiring to experience a workplace with such cunning and harmonious ways of doing business, especially when you are fully equipped to help dozens of people a day solve a staggering variety of issues.
The most difficult part of this occupation is when you are approached with an unknown problem. We don't accept failure and are absolutely determined to find a solution, but if we do not have the resources to find said solution, we connect the customer to outside resources who can.

I had stellar managers who were very helpful and really cared about my development as an AHA. We often would video chat and if I had a problem or a question they were only one call away. They work in teams, and all the team managers cared just as much as my personal ones did.

The hardest part of the job was telling a customer that they did not have coverage on the product they were calling about, and that ultimately, unless they paid a fee, I was not permitted to help them.

Swapping/ giving away shifts were nearly impossible as part timers were not allowed to work over 29 hours. In terms of benefits, Part Timers are not offered tuition reimbursement which made absolutely no sense as the majority of the company is made up of part timers.

Things I learned actually boosted and improved my performance in the customer service field, training was wonderful.
Coworkers were very helpful, if any was needed and were not afraid to ask on the opposite end if they needed any.
The hardest part of the job was when a customer would call and we do our best to resolve the problem, but to no avail. There is no question that we sometime come across defective products, in those situations even though I could not help, I empathized with the customer and let them know that we will continually work together to solve the issue.
Of course the most enjoyable part was the fact that i get to help people from all walks of life with their iProducts, Period.
The management was saved for last because that is the con. The metric system used to determine our performance I feel is heavily flawed because a customer may choose to give a bad review because ""his product does not come with a manual"" or things of that nature.

I think it comes down to the individual, your drivers, where you're at in you personal life, and where you want to go with your career. I'm thankful for the quality of home life it's afforded me, but not the emotional toll it has taken.
And now that I'm later in career, I've even been told by mgmt lately that they were ""looking for someone earlier in career."" (yeah, I know, HR would be all over that one!).

Leadership focus is on metrics and speed of delivery. Quality relationships and team building are thrown out the window when the metrics aren't being met.

There's also no focus on career building. If I hear ""you own your career"" one more time....sigh. The quandary is, you get told that, then when you take ownership, you hear things like ""this is where we see your career going.""

I was hired as an expert to help them implement Agile and was not only ignored but actively disparaged by management who believed the effort was just a process change and not a mindset change.

The Agile community is a small world and I was warned about this before accepting the job and ignored it. At almost every Agile event I go to, there is someone there from Cisco complaining about this same exact issue so the problem is endemic at the company.

The work/life balance is great for parents, and there is virtually zero pressure to complete work on-time or ""correctly."" Since the culture of the company skews older, many managers are empathetic to last-minute PTO requests, and extensions on deadlines are always viable. This means that there is no expectation to ""crunch,"" which can be a great relief to anyone who's about to burnout from the fast-paced software industry.

Unfortunately, these cultural values come at a cost. The company operates at a painfully slow pace, as there is no incentive to address issues as they arise. Sometimes the engineer that is blocking you is on PTO for a week or is a contractor overseas that only answers emails 9-5, their time. This becomes exasperated when you must navigate across more than four separate employees for access to basic tools/technology/documentation, a common issue with large companies.

Budding, young developers should beware. There are certainly things to learn from Cisco and its products. However, sticking around for too long may cause complacency and an inability to effectively participate in other, faster companies.Laid-back Workplace, But Breeds Complacency",0,5,3,1.0,1,2,0,1,0.0,0,0,2,1.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0,1,0.095,0.775,0.13,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0175

1423,1742,238,cmp-review-63ca73b6d3988b8d,Cisco,"From my experience, there are two main items to keep in mind:

1. Your manager is going to have a lot to do with your comfort at Cisco. I happened to love both of my managers but your mileage here may vary. There is no single management school or track that managers at Cisco go on so you can get a fantastic manager or a terrible one and it has nothing to do with Cisco.

2. Generally the benefits are better and the pay is better at Cisco. Also, you can work remotely. This covers up for a lot of other things missing from other companies. This is *not* a place that does perks like ergonomic desks or company parties.


After that, the most important aspect of my work here is that you are not being babysat. If you are not a self-starter who self-manages, it's hard to function here. This was both good and bad:

Good: You are being treated like a professional and an adult. You work on your own project on your own time and you can come in at 4 in the morning -- they don't seem to care. You can also generally work remotely from home, a coffee shop, or the North Atlantic. It's getting things done not getting-things-done-while-wearing-the-correct-outfit.

Bad: It's hard to tell what's going on behind the scenes, with leadership, even in the cube next to yours. There's a hardcore engineer-style DIY culture here where you're supposed to just figure it out. That can be very frustrating if you need to get something done and don't know how or who handles it. It's also easy to go a little crazy when you don't know whether your project is going well or poorly.

Help files and tutorials are all at your fingertips, but if you don't know where to look, help may not very difficult to find, even if you ask multiple people. The company leverages a solid communications backbone to provide seamless real-time communications among all of their worldwide offices through online meetings, email, and instant messaging. I was not used to this environment, so it took me a while to become comfortable. Our office was also an open plan with all of the positives and negatives associated with that kind of space. My co-workers were very friendly and very helpful.

The biggest caveat for an hourly-wage contract position is their December break, which is a week-long office closing around that coincides with Christmas and New Year's. This arrangement poses no problems to a salaried employee, but an hourly employee loses one quarter of his or her salary for that month. Given the plethora of contract workers Cisco employs, I'm surprised this is not more of a concern among the workforce. It was the only time I experienced a Christmas negative bonus.

1) I took the job over another job, even though it was at a lower pay rate, due to the name. On a resume Cisco will always look great.

2) It is best to quit your Cisco job, find another placement in another company for 1 year and return to Cisco, if you want a higher salary. If you stay in the same company for too long, they forget who you are, never grant you a raise and expect you to quit. Saves them money in the end.

3) If you dont mind managers being across the globe as well as changing every 11 months, you are a perfect fit. I did not mind the managers being globally spaced out. I did mind that they changed every 11 months just prior to your evaluation which they use to recommend your salary rates. This is a typical tactic, if your new manager doesnt know you, they cannot fight on your behalf to grant you a raise.

Working at home is the best, and only Cisco can allow you to be 100% work from home with a real salary. I do work longer hours at home, but its at home, so you dont really feel it as much as if you were driving to the office at 8 am and finishing at 1am like I do for my job now.

Bottom line, salary is not why you choose Cisco. If you do, dont choose Cisco, because many many other companies pay much more for the same amount of effort involved to work at Cisco.

You cannot move up more than one job level per year, you cannot increase your salary by more than 20% per year by any means, and you cannot leave your department without one year in role. The one of these that is the major issue is the 20% salary increase. Should you start entry level, your salary is so low that 20% is not enough head room to move into a position you are actually qualified for. The only way around this is to quit and then get rehired else you have to work at the company for 5 years plus to get into a decent job. You are told grand tales of being able to move within the company once you get in, but those are daydreams at best. The work culture is great and the company treats you well most of the time.

Personal time demands are routine and chronic, while comp is flat over a long time horizon. Take time off and you are expected to take on the workload of a colleague, when they take time off.

Lazy management and bad leadership is rampant up and down the chain of command, often accompanied by an absence of ethical and moral behavior.

A typical day involves chasing down other individuals to ask them to do their job, and in return receiving back pressure due to workload and staffing imbalances. Escalation is a manual process, with onerous update requirements. Updates are routinely not read by recipients.

False positive urgency is characteristic of day to day demands, with over reaction to incidents that have small marginal impact on revenue and customer experience.

After that, the promotions stopped. Raises stopped. This was primarily due to ""shifts and organizational changes"" because Dell announced their plan to purchase EMC and so all teams were on standby until the merger was completed. After over a year of talks the merger went through. After this, contractors of the LOWEST level were promoted (offered full-time jobs) but engineers such as myself (who were under contract) were not offered full-time positions. They decided to let our contracts run out. Dell (or EMC, not sure who's in charge) is trying to save money wherever possible and the way the company is run in comparison to when it was just EMC is not great.

Managers do not come from an engineering background.

New contractors don't seem to know what an ethernet cable is.

The one saving grace is that everyone was in it together, and all the engineers have a great dynamic and comradery. I did enjoy working on projects, but as metrics became more important than employee satisfaction, we saw people leaving to find brighter/greener pastures.

They keep hiring management with no workers to do the job on shore. Dell is top heavy. There is NO room for growth onshore. They seem to promote offshore to management positions....ha ha ha...clueless people.....They give NO raises. If you have a family plan, your co pay is about 1000.00 a month for coverage that has thousands in deductibles. My pay has gone down every year. There is limited staff onshore..because most of it is Offshore. They keep piling on more work to the few folks that are left onshore. The excellent workers have been leaving for more money and better benefits.

Dell has a high turnover rate.

They also will fight giving unemployment to anyone they lay off or fire. my advice - if you are laid off by dell and they refuse to give you unemployment, choose to fight the decision and call in to the court hearing. their lawyers wont show up. At dell they make it widely known that ""Tech Support it an unwanted expense to dells profit margin"" how ever we are what brought customers back to dell. at its core dell is just another call center environment. after dell laid me off, i was thankful for the whole year i was un-employed that i didn't have to get up and go to work in the morning for Dell. it was at dell that i discovered HR doesn't work for the employees rights - it works for the corporations rights over the employees.Dell In Oklahoma City",1,2,4,0.0,0,1,0,1,1.0,0,0,1,0.0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,1,3,0,2,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,1,0.124,0.779,0.097,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.2365

Compensation is decent, but advancement in the company is mired in red tape. After applying to a job on their internal site, I was told that I wouldn't be considered for a position because the pay disparity between the position I was in and the position I was applying for was too great. I was more than qualified for the position in every other way. My HR rep went as far as to suggest my leaving the company and reapplying after 9 months for the position I wanted as being an alternative.

After working at Dell for several years without meaningful increase in my compensation due to several company-wide hiring/raise freezes which always seemed to correspond to our team's end of year reviews, I was laid off because much of my team's job functions had been ported to agencies in the US, China, and India.

I tried Dell again and worked as a contractor nine months later, with the hopes that I'd be hired on permanently. Within 11 months the entire team I was on was laid off because they decided to take the functions and practices we designed for them and port them to a team in India.

We were in phone sales working mostly with US, West Coast customers. Our job was to assist our clients with scaling and planning of their technology needs and providing the best options for those needs. Most of my clients were on a 4-6 month buying cycle, so the projects were managed from inception to installation. Our managers were excellent and provided assistance and guidance as needed. Product knowledge training was essential to completing the job, and Dell was great at not only providing internal training, but getting our vendors to visit and provide first hand knowledge on their products that we sold. The best part of working at Dell for me was the team environment that our managers fostered. We all really worked well together. And I would say that leaving was the hardest part. Unfortunately, business needs sometime require cutting back and I was released in a headcount reduction.

(i.e. people with families or what I call good ole boys or the stereotypical all american guy or if a woman then the sorority girl, cheerleader stereotype or more on the flirty side) If a person is not one of these things it is definitely harder for them to get ahead of the game or to control their own destiny at Dell. Let me be to the point, right now at Dell I don't see any Gay men in leadership positions at Dell. I like to believe that Dell is a diverse work environment but being honest, I got far fast at Dell until managers got to know me and found out I was gay and then personally investing in me as a person was non existent.

The other aspect of Dell that is good or bad depending on when you ask someone who works for Dell is their compensation plan.

Dell managers for the most part aren't micro managers, but there are a few still out there. Everyone can get a little obsessed on hitting metrics versus booking business for the company. For example you could achieve your daily quota but if you didn't make 50 outbound phone calls, you might still get threaten with a written warning. It's elements like that which led me to pursue other opportunities.

Most the people you work with will become great friends but across three campus sites, you can get a little resentment from your fellow coworkers as you cannot get credit for an order you worked on if someone else steals it at the last moment. Again this is a fact of a sales job, and anyone looking for a good sales job should expect this with any company.

Finally, Dell doesn't pay for overtime in the traditional way.

It's difficult to review an entire company when the company is so huge and diverse. It really depends on the team and manager. Some teams have terrible work/life balance, especially mission-critical teams, like IT. It's not uncommon to hear about 80-100 hour weeks and working through the weekends on those teams. On the other hand, some teams, like marketing, have excellent balance. Your schedule can be what you need it to be. It can be easy to get time off. The entire week of Christmas is a company holiday.

Also, some teams have a lot of redundancy. It can be easy on some teams to feel disconnected to anything valuable or to just feel like you're spinning your wheels. Other teams are very clearly connected to customer satisfaction and company goals, and it's easy to see how your daily work impacts the bigger picture.

Dell has its own culture. It emphasizes the ability to move around from one position to another. It provides a lot of great opportunities to do completely different things while remaining at the same company and location. It's not hard to find yourself in a position and with responsibilities that you could not have found elsewhere. It can really help to build experiences and skills. The downside of that is that the organization is constantly in flux. It can be hard to figure out who owns what at any given time. It's easy to repeat mistakes because it's difficult to maintain institutional learnings. Picking up a new role can feel like starting from scratch.

EMC is a very hardworking company that expects you to work hard for as long as it takes. Your rewards will be determined by your business unit, but there will be no space for work/life balance.

Everything at EMC revolves around putting in 200% everyday without adequite resources, and combatting poor direction & poor communication.

I left the company when I found that consistently 50% of my major projects each year where abandoned mid stream due to politics or poor direction from management.

As someone who thinks strategically, it was VERY hard to determine just what the company's goal was on a regular basis.

EMC's biggest challenge is that it fails to keep the company's infrastructure in pace with it's growth. There is a lot of the ""slap it together & we'll fix it later"" mentality. Quality was often a non-issue when compared to a deadline, even for internal products that were not customer facing.

Don't get me wrong, EMC paid me HANDSOMELY, but you should plan on changing business units every few years to avoid burnout if you choose to work there.

You should also make peace with the fact that you will spend a lot of time on dead end efforts that had no budget or strategy to begin with.Good pay, no work/life balance",0,1,4,0.0,1,3,0,0,1.0,1,1,1,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,0,0.0,1,2,0,3,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,1,0.16,0.749,0.09,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.21499999999999997

However, as a company, either this vision is taking an awful long time to come to fruition and we're way ahead of the curve, or it is not playing out like the upper management would like. IBM was once a 100 billion dollar revenue generating company. No more. Five straight years of declining revenue says something about the vision at the top or the execution of that vision.

Unfortunately, the company has lost it's way in finding new ways to replace declining revenue streams in their traditional businesses (hardware, software, services). They have missed several paradigm shifts in the industry and have been playing catch up (cloud services is the most recent example) for many years. The financial results reported over a fair amount of time have been the result of selling off of lines of business, selling real estate, layoffs and reducing the cost of labor by moving jobs to offshore locations. Revenue has been flat or down for many, many quarters.

As a place to work, it was great most of the time. Very knowledgeable employees, I learned a great deal, and there were great education/training tools available for those that wanted to take advantage of them. Benefits were good but like everywhere else, more of the health care coverage costs were being shifted to the employee. Work/life balance depended on what job role you were in. Due to the declining revenue issues, all parts of the business were affected by the need to do more with less (meaning fewer workers, more work). By far the worst area I ever worked in was Finance. Really long hours and a constant maniacal drive to cut cost and expense year after year.

Overall, a good place to get a start for young college graduates. I am no longer confident one will be able to make a long term career there.

The work like balance can be outstanding in certain divisions with the exception of the hourly billable divisions like GBS. Work from home is typical for most of the employees which is a sizable benefit which can make the rough edges of IBM seem less bothersome.

Management is changing slowly, but there is an extreme lack of real world experience at all levels of management as to the expectations of what customers really want. Most of the management team is made of up of decade plus IBM legacy survivors or the person who killed their quota last year and is not based on actual management ability, vision, or coaching ability. It is unfortunate, because there are some amazingly intelligent and deeply experienced people in the company and some good and some horrible managers.

IBM is an insanely inflexible company when it comes to compensation. If you did not come into IBM at a number you can live with, you will likely be disappointed with your salary. Senior leaders should not considering coming into IBM at any band less than a 10. True Executive positions start with a Band D with actual the senior top company VPs and SVP being at band B or A.

Many amazing C-Level thought leaders were lied to on the recruiting process and are stuck at salary limiting band 8 and band 9 levels and do not get promoted or awarded pay increases. As a general policy is it nearly impossible to get promoted up to the next band unless you have had at least two years in a band. It takes a near miracle to jump from a band 10 into an executive level position.

Unfortunately, this is a top down organization that either is not open to hearing feedback or ideas from Directors or other managers.

That or, director level and up have only one thing in mind, keeping my job today. So they will say yes to anything the top pushes down.

When executives chart a direction or make a strategy or staffing change, no one has considered the consequences OR placed plans to mitigate risk to the customer, risk to their sales numbers/results, or to employees.

This is powerpoint lead. Upper management loves their monthly report outs which change very slightly due to the long product buy cycle.

So if you don't mind crunching numbers and grabbing info from many places for a good part of the week, you may not like it at IBM.

Benefits like healthcare and compensation are not up to industry par but the ONE benefit that kept any decent talent was working from home. But now, they have eliminated that.

The only positives I had was my team. They were fantastic to work with and really cared and killed themselves to make a real difference for their customers.

After a few people (including my manager) left, I cycled through a few different teams and always found the ""global team"" dynamic to be a bit isolating. Managers that lived in different countries that never met me, communication with team members was often difficult to find and many people working while not on the same page.Visual Designer at IBM",0,4,4,0.0,0,3,0,0,0.0,0,0,2,0.0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,1,4,0,3,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0,1,0.021,0.827,0.152,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.3155

The IBM integration team sold us on tools that didn't work well with our team and presented us with limited options. Later on we found out there were additional options that would have worked way better for our team but had additional costs. It was as if the person in head of the integration was going to receive a bonus if he kept the integration under a certain budget but unfortunately the teams are affected well after the integration was completed as they were stuck with tools that did not meet their needs. Additionally IBM paid their employees way more than Kenexa, and IBM took over 2 years to give any of the Kenexa employees raises while hiring new employees at the IBM rate. So new employees with no company experience were getting paid more than people who had worked there for years. There was also so much process to everything that it took forever to get anything done especially since a lot of the process was not well documented. I stuck around as long as I could as I had made a lot of great friends at Kenexa who still worked there but after a while it was not worth it. I left the company without even having another job lined up as I couldn't stand working there another minute.

There are serious challenges that as a manager I deal with on a daily basis. Level setting client expectations, dealing with escalations, and expected to answer every call at any given time can absorb all mental strengths from you. I currently manage 5 teams (Intel, VMWare, MF, Notes Domino, and Backup/Recovery) so there is always an issue that I am working through with the client at any given time. As a manager, you're also expected to perform a 24/7 week shift of on call incident manager where you're paged out for every production issue in the environment. It is a very challenging environment and client with a non-stop pace.
Having to manage so many different towers on this account, I've been forced to learn about each platform that I have which has been a great plus for my experience. Level setting client expectations, improving SLAs, and collaborating in multi-team tasks/issues has also made me a better manager.
Management is currently a challenge. We've brought in new execs to the account and over the past few months communications within the account team have been close to a trickle at best. With the previous execs, we had a continuous flow of information and regular meetings, but the two new execs appear to not operate in such manner which has caused concern among the account team.

At some point something will crash (and sometimes even burn) and will need immediate attention while still doing your day-to-day obligations. #Multitasking

Management (myself included) want answers the minute something goes down. What caused it? How long will it take to fix it? What can we do to prevent it from happening again? Same questions each time even before the software engineer can have time to analyze what the problem is. #Smile

Working for IBM I had the opportunity to work with people from around the globe. Yes, there are some language barriers but we managed quite well and have a lot of fun laughing at each other.

I love working with people of different nationalities. It's interesting to learn about the different customs and cultures. This is definitely the most enjoyable part of my job.

One thing you have to understand, while working in IT, is that it doesn't know the time or day. Systems don't just need your attention 8-5 M-F.

My wife worked in finance and her worst manager was decent. The only real complaint I can raise is that one manager demanded she stay late for a meeting and later canceled said meeting without informing my wife (keeping both of us late since we carpooled). We finally had to call to find out it was canceled as much as an hour after the meeting time. This is the ONLY incident I know of, for her, in the 18 years she was in finance with the company.

Me? My managers were either very good, or quite bad.

Example: I was given an award and the man who put me in for the award called to congratulate me and revealed that he put me in for said award (he'd been working for IBM 30+ years at the time so had some ways of knowing things he should not have, like my award went through). My manager stopped by just after he'd called and told me that IBM had changed their awards policies and thus it was not possible to give out many small awards, only singleton large awards. My award was actually meant for the team, would I mind signing it over to him?

This basically took any joy or pride in the award away from me. It was patently wrong, if not illegal. I scared him away by talking about tax implications and I suspect that he had no way to work around that so backed off. I DID share my award with my team by buying them gifts that year (it was very near Christmas time).

When I got hired as an employee, I was happy that I didn't have to take the pay cut or furlough, but there is no security. 2 years after I got hired I got laid off along with several other people who have been there 15-15 years.Good work/life balance for the most part, but no security",0,4,3,0.0,1,3,0,0,1.0,0,0,4,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,1,3,0,1,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,0.0,1,0.111,0.764,0.125,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.006999999999999999

Managers were directed to pass out low performance reviews so IBM could save money when laying off their employees. The performance pay was tied to your severance pay.

The employees continue to work but they do not get the recognition or the compensation deserved and it's only a matter of time before those left in the US will be laid off as well.

For example, the work/life balance at Indeed is great, and there's healthcare coverage! The maternity leave here is awesome, and there are some outreach efforts to impact our surrounding community.

If you're not in one of the main office branches, you can't expect any personal development or career openings for further growth. Additionally, you may have a Manager/Director who will tell you that your feedback is valuable, but will in turn negate any feedback you share; no matter how tactfully you’ve presented it. In some instances, feedback given has been used to negatively impact employees during quarterly reviews. This kind of gaslighting is disappointing, but it's what you can expect if you plan to work in the San Mateo office.

Further, there is blatant favoritism amongst Managers/Directors, even to the point of promoting less experienced Indeed employees to senior positions. Given how political the office culture is, it's starting to resemble high school as opposed to a professional working environment.

Depending on where you are coming from, Indeed can be a great place to build your skill set. If you hone in on certain aspects of the role, you will become much more marketable in the Bay Area after working for Indeed.

Cons:

Favoritism is the biggest issue the San Mateo office has. Certain people get more support and resources then others. This is fine sometimes, but everyday it gets old quick. It really depletes from the culture, and when the wrong people are promoted, it looks like this favoritism is actually driving the direction of the company culture.

Indeed says its a company interested in feedback from employees, but this is not actually the case. Expect gas lighting, and expect to be a ""yes man"" and nothing else. Not only will your feedback go unheard, it can often count against you later. General processes are also ill communicated between management and teams.

There is almost no advancement within the San Mateo office because there are only two departments that sit there.

To make things more difficult for Staffing AEs there are minimum sizes to the deals which you can close. Your minimums are double what your counterparts on the direct employer side can close. So not only are the clients more difficult to close, your budgets are also twice as limiting as your colleagues. This means deals are more difficult to come by and less commission dollars. There is no monetary compensation for your restrictions, only pride that you're working in the most difficult vertical.

Indeed is growing exponentially, which is great. But to keep up with growth, they end up promoting people internally that are only qualified because they're friends with management. So the office has quickly turned into a sorority clique where friends promote friends. If you are very close with your manager on a personal level, you will do great! If not, you will not be supported and you will quickly find yourself looking for other opportunities. Indeed is much more political than they would have you believe.

Because these managers have no experience, they have unrealistic expectations of their employees. This sets people up for failure and creates a terrible work environment. I (and others) learned the hard way that you can't trust anything management says. I never knew where I stood and I suffered anxiety attacks on a regular basis. HR is also young and inexperienced, so they will not help you.

The benefits Indeed offers are great, but in the end, if management is terrible, talented people will leave.

People aren't leaving like they used to nor are they being fired. Indeed has been providing new hires with the tools necessary to succeed.

That said, you have to be careful that you don't stop learning. The product is fairly one dimensional, so it's pretty easy to do so. If things stop getting challenging, you're staying there too long. For most people, this happens in about 1 and a half to 2 years. By then, you'll learn everything you can about the company. I say this as a caveat to anyone looking to apply. By all means do so, but be aware that you're not making a huge, long term career leap.

- This is a 'churn and burn' culture for Account Execs, they do not value sales reps as long term investments. You will be trained for a couple weeks and then thrown to the world of cold calling in a saturated marketplace
- Indeed is now a household name, good luck finding prospects that the previous 1000+reps have been harassing over the past 5 years
- Companies like indeed are fantastic to work for in their first 3-5 years but that's long gone
- Management is awful so if you're a rookie, you're on your own.

You can actually do your very best work and your review will sometimes be a roll of the dice--again, depending on the all-powerful manager. Having been a manager there, I know what I'm talking about with crystal clarity.

Intel's culture is old-school and so evening and weekend work is typical. Teams can feel the stress of pushing and pushing until a project is completed and for management to reassess is not an option. Their own job is on the line concerning meeting release dates.

The culture is also very competitive. You may develop great relationships there, but when you don't know someone too well yet, take care that you aren't dealing with someone who is collecting information to use for his benefit and use against you. Although this is usually not the case, it has happened to me from time to time. Just be careful about what you reveal to others.

The official word is that I didn't do enough my last couple of years to show personal growth in my job; not demonstrate enough of an interest to learn other things. The reality is that there simply wasn't anywhere else for me to go in my job, short of becoming a manager or leaving for another department. I'm in communications. What do I do next -- become an engineer?

Intel's big on ""personal growth."" They don't like it if you stay in one job too long; they'd rather have you move on to a different area after a few years. In theory, this creates a well-rounded employee. In practice, if forces you out of what you do best and into a role that you may not be suited for, which can lead to -- you guessed it -- subpar performance and loss of job. The company's executives face the same situation; there's been three different CIOs since 2008; our department had four managers in six years. You end up with a supervisor who isn't consistently trained, doesn't know all facets of their job (and who may have become a supervisor simply to show that crucial ""growth"") and makes mistakes that harm others' careers.

As a result, there's a lot of stress beneath the smiles people give as you walk down the hall.

Groups I've typically worked in for Intel employ some form of Agile development, and as such, you get to be a software developer, software validation, and automation engineer at any point. While it can be demanding, this GREATLY increases your overall useful skillset and has helped me immensely in my professional career. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes there are some VERY demanding schedules, but you get paid back on the other end with recognition and having easier weeks/months as well. My co-workers are some of the brightest minds in their respective fields and getting to work closely with some of Intel's Fellows and Senior Fellows was its own reward. Management can swing wildly however between the two different styles of groups. Money making groups tend to have happier employees and plenty of budget to make work fun. As such, management in these groups attracts the best managers available. On the other hand, money ""saving"" groups, or groups that only look to make certain parts of Intel process more efficient tend to have low turn over rates and higher job security at the cost of deeply unrewarding work. These type of groups tend to foster a mistrust of your co-workers as everyone is directly in contention for promotions and good reviews. On the other side, the money making groups tend to take the approach of ""a rising tide raises all ships"", so if they group does well, everyone in it tends to WANT to do well and works hardProductive and fun work atmosphere with some of the greatest engineering minds",0,5,4,0.0,1,5,0,1,0.0,0,0,4,0.0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,1,5,0,4,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,0.0,1,0.016,0.751,0.233,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.3585

Engineers are treated badly, make less than techs when adjusted for work hours and are on call 24/7 365 - no work/life balance.
The work is babysitting tools that break all the time and babysitting vendors who fix the tools and being called at all hours of the night to dispo tools failing. The R&D aspect of the job is squeezing every last die out of a wafer ""called layer work"".

Group leaders are treated even worse than engineers....On call for the fleet of tools, little salary increase- maybe, but many make less than incoming RCGs. GLs get lots of responsibilities, but little pay increase and they will be on site in the fab on the weekends - every weekend.

I do not approve of the CEO because a good business man would not allow the heart of Intel ""PTD"" to treat engineers so badly. A 60 billion dollar company can't afford to hire a hundred engineers to put the fab on shift......So they deal with 50% attrition by year 2.

They can make you on a great career path, or you can be left to the wolves. Intel lays off a lot of people each year in the annual review process. ""They hire the best"" but they also layoff a certain percentage (target) in the annual review. Its not terribly hard to beat the odds and not be the one let go. However you have to play the game, and not be the one that gets picked for sacrifice. Since they did away with the pension benefit several years ago and reduce the profit sharing percentage the compensation has gone down a little bit.

I've worked at Intel twice, both times were excellent until mgmt changed and then it wasn't great. So if you are interviewing really think hard if you would 'like' to be with the manager weather the message is good or bad. Also, look out for behavioral interviewing, its been part of training in the past, i think its not worth the time, but it occurs. Also, as someone who opened a REQ in the past to hire someone, please be upfront about your VISA stations/right to work in the USA. Most of the applicants i got when i had positions open were F, B, or H visas we weren't going to pay for or go thru the process.

*Let that be an indicator to the work culture, environment, and management.

Non-existent JLL training to do your job properly.

Non-existent help from upper management. Ghosting you when you email your manager. I repeatedly asked for help and was talked down to by a manager who was an off- site manager who was supposed to be giving assistance to us, as we we're still trying to learn our jobs. Very hostile person. This person should be fired. It's a true sign as to why they can't keep employees in this particular site.

Asking you to do more jobs without compensation, or proper training. Essentially throwing work on you that you don't know how to do.

Absolutely no support or direction. I guess that's why they've gone through so many managers for the last 15 years.

Managers messing with your pay!

While working for the President of the NY region, my days were more predictable including working on presentations, setting up meetings, travel and whatever operations tasks were needed.

A typical workday involves sorting hundreds of pieces of mail from various company locations from Sacramento to San Diego; some days are super busy and other days are slow.

As an employee for over a decade, I've learned many things such as, conflicts can be and are healthy, management at every level should be open to ideas from their employees, different employee backgrounds are beneficial because they bring will about fresh viewpoints and ideas, the organization values those who driven and goal-oriented, and people must be able to adapt to change because the organization is continually evolving.

Management can either be encouraging or difficult to deal with, depending on the person who's in charge. Every manager has a unique approach to handling various situations and problems that may arise. A good manager will cause their employees to always want to go the extra mile for them. I've had some managers who made me want to go to work, and some who made me dread going to work.

They have a pay scale based on experience but they will short you if you don't speak up- I was shorted about 6 years of experience and didn't realize it until I saw my union contract. This is something you won't find out until you have already signed away your ability to negotiate, so be aware of their pay scale and don't sign until they match your pay with your experience. I was shorted approximately $10/hour due to this, and was one of the reasons I quit the job. Also make sure they have you on the right pay scale for the department you work in- level 2 would be inpatient, level 3 and 4 for critical care and ER- and these pay differentials add up to a lot of money. I personally believe that Kaiser has gotten so big that it isn't able to adapt at a reasonable pace to changes in patient load and staffing, which is why you can expect a phone call almost every day to come in for short-staffing.

Moved into a corporate position in Regional quality during a time of new executive directors who were not competent in their leadership of the newly reorganized business unit between patient safety, quality regulatory services. I didn't receive training, started head into the middle of projects and was not given opportunity to work with another peer consultant. With 20 years of clinical experience my boss didn't find me a good fit. I requested for training in performance improvement and was denied. I was nominated by my peers, but my boss just didn't find me as a good fit. She evaluated me well in behaviors but in skill she felt I was not the right fit and would be better off in clinical since it is my strongest area. She terminated me and gave me 25 minutes to clear my desk after 18 months with quality but 19 years with Kaiser Permanente. She also made it clear that I was not hireable with Kaiser which is up to the manager that is terminating the employee.

En masse, you are assigned specific breaks and cannot use the bathroom or get a drink or snack outside of those times. There are cameras EVERYWHERE so there is literally nowhere to make a personal call; you are even forbidden from leaving the building during your lunch break. Dress code is extremely bizarre and random, no scarves or jewelry--which is odd b/c there is no patient contact. There is extreme tension between management and staff. Daily, edicts are handed down with new rules which are enforced in a draconian manner. Every call you receive is recorded and you are encouraged as a new advice triage nurse to ask your charge for assistance or advice. When you do, and execute that exact instruction, you can be written up if it veers at all from the ""manual."" Further, do not think that asking the advice MD on call for his/her advice will be heeded. Even their call on difficult decisions (whether a pt should go to ER or primary dr) is irrelevant if it doesn't follow the 'manual."" And no amount of documentation will cover you. BEWARE.

Pay is usually higher than you will find in similar jobs with other non-consulting companies, but their benefits aren't really that great. Insurance is expensive, poor 401(K) matching, they give max of 2.5% if you contribute at least 5%.

Job security is always contingent on not crossing of the wrong person.

Employees get to work with many talented people. Not to mention a job at a Big Four looks great on your resume.

On the downside, if you look at the Best Places to work lists - you will find KPMG either listed below every other Big Four firm or completely absent from the list. Top management can make all the excuses they want but it comes down to two primary issues.

Management loves to take credit for success but blames underlings for failures. Either way you aren't going to share in the money pouring into the firm.

Second, management likes to play favorites and no one seems to be willing to reel these managers in. Companies need to be able to show why one employee was promoted over another and in many cases a halfway good lawyer could prove that this was not the case.

Over the years I watched countless talented employees jump ship to the other Big Four Accounting firms. As a result, many people who do remain and work up to Partner or Principal aren't the best and brightest.

If you find yourself working for this firm and want anything other than a very, very slow climb to the top - take as many classes as you can and constantly look for a position at one of the other Big Four Accounting firms.

On Fridays, you are implicitly expected to go into your local office to take care of some administrative work and network.

I had been moving from project to project every 6 or 8 months. However, I've found myself on a very long term engagement and have started to feel stagnant in my role. I've struggled to transition away from this project.

As my first job out of college, I expected some substantial guidance and training. I felt a rather consistent lack of support in this regard. I often felt like the development path picked for me was not fully considered.

In spite of some of the frustrations depicted here,I have no regrets about joining the firm. My co-workers have been typically great to work with and approachable. If you are prepared to travel and firmly drive your own career path (and experienced doing so), there can be great opportunity for you here.

It is still a great place to work with respect to learning about, and implementing, new technology. They also provide many opportunities to get involved in side-projects to expand your exposure to new technology. There is also AMPLE opportunity to get career and technical mentoring there.

They still have the **BEST** employee benefits compared to anywhere in the US. I would still recommend MSFT to college graduates looking for initial technical skill development so they can move on to something else. Compensation has never been stellar at MSFT - but its good enough. Work/Life balance has improved greatly since the 90's.

However, I would no longer recommend it as a place to climb the ladder or get job advancement. MSFT has taken more to hiring people from the outside, and preserving their middle-management 'in-crowd' by continually providing lateral transfers to that group in order to maintain the careers of the anointed few. They have also implemented regional hiring practices to the detriment of many. Thus, even though you may do great promotion-worthy work in Redmond, WA, you will not get the job if the company decides that the job has to be filled in Las Colinas, TX!

Sadly their culture of late has gone off the deep end injecting west-coast political-correctness into the work place. They are on board with all of the 'sanctuary' politics of the day.

In this project I was a true, contributing member of the team—attending meetings, making informed design decisions—and my word was trusted and valued. All-around I was seen as a top-performer and integral part of the project. Even after the product shipped I was told the product wouldn't have been what it was without me.

When I was taken off the project by my manager, I was back on the same grind where my skills were nowhere near close to being utilized to my potential.

Microsoft is a big company with many teams. Overall the work experience is very positive but in such a large company, the culture can vary quite a bit from team to team and MS is no exception.

The different cultures across the different teams can make this challenging.

Re: Compensation/Benefits
You make quite a bit, but you won't be able to afford a house on single income within 15 miles of HQ in Redmond which means you're renting or buying a house and commuting for an hour each way. The benefits are not on par with other tech companies of their foot print. Their cafeteria food is also sub-par and significantly overpriced.

In Support/Operations, advancement is rare but secure for the most part. Everyone is checked out, so don't expect much validation.

Microsoft simply does not care about you. They only see the bottom line. There is no support, no care, just more work and more responsibility for the same amount of pay.

The most positive aspect of my day is that I can find a job that fits my personal life-style, meaning I have a flexible schedule. This does limit my choices for advancement of course, but it's a welcome compromise. Also, Microsoft is loaded with incredibly intelligent people, which makes work fun and challenging. I do not find myself questioning my manager's decision-making skills, which is nice.

We would frequently have big names come to the store, and even have big wig Xbox affiliates/execs come in to check out how things were.

That aside, however, your mileage of enjoyment at the work place will vary. Depending on management they can make life very hard and stressful. As well the work/life balance is non-existent. You would work 9+ hours a day as full-time, depending on if you closed or not, and you were essentially forced into doing volunteer work. This kind of goes against the entire definition of VOLUNTEER work, but I digress. Even if you had numerous other priorities in your daily job duties, there were always more things piled on, such as teaching what's called ""workshops"" to customers. This is fine and good, except you never got time to study at work. You'd likely have to cheat and work off the clock to study the material you're supposed to teach. If you didn't? Have fun with the proverbial instance of making a speech in your underwear. You'd be totally unprepared for both the material you're trying to instruct as well as questions they may have.

From day one, I was taught that it is about the customer, not the company. We provide what the company designs and makes and our job is to teach them to understand it, use it, and make the purchasing experience as painless and efficient as possible. I have never worked for any organization where the most important thing was the customer experience and sales itself were considered a benefit or afterthought because of the experience.

Every day, we'd have a meeting about our goals for the day, events, coworker camaraderie, but never sales first. Our financial goals came at the end of the meeting so that the vast majority of the meeting was spent talking about new tech, our coworkers, the new experiences we might give customers, and any new stock that might cater towards a certain customer.

It is an amazing experience that I cannot see being duplicated anywhere else. It fosters your creativity, talent, drive, goals, and pushes your limits in a positive manner. You are constantly pushed to learn, grow, adapt, and adjust your experience to the customer's needs. They ask for your input and, most importantly, want your input about the experience and any ideas you have about enhancing it.

There is international contact even for positions that are domestic in nature. Provides opportunity to work with and learn from colleagues in other regions (Europe, Asia, Latin America, etc.).

Great benefits (variety of free drinks and some snacks). Many jobs allow for flexibility to work remotely (e.g. from home, remote offices, etc.). Much is expected of the employees including long days and sometimes weekends. Co-workers (mostly) great to work with. They are driven yet easy to get along with. One tough situation is that performance is not only measured against objectives, but against your colleagues. At yearly review time, it creates a bit of a tense environment, but it's manageable.
Management: in a 100,000 employee and approximately 30-40,000 contractors, the talent varies. The process for establishing performance objectives is very well established so ""self-management"" is very important. In addition, there are constant re-organizations so that could be distracting. There is a constant effort to minimize bureaucracy given the size of the company.
Lots of virtual team work with regular progress reviews. Weekly for run operations and core teams, monthly and quarterly with management. A lot of interdependence with other groups so cross group collaboration is a must.

Learned a great deal technically as well as how to deal with different people and teams with varying goals, technical knowledge and personalities.

In my tenure at Microsoft, I've had some great managers who have strived to do the best for the customers and also for the team.

In general, co-workers were very nice to work with. In some teams, depending on the culture being driven by management, there wasn't much cooperation and collaboration among devs and PMs. But most times, co-workers were willing to work towards a common goal and help each other out.

I've heard stories of a few good departments, but the majority of the people I know who currently work there, or who have worked there, are deeply unhappy and constantly stressed to the point that their health was impacted and they ended up in hospital. In 8 years as a full-time employee, I had 11 changes in who I reported to. In addition, the yearly performance reviews are graded on a curve and there are quotas to give a number of ""bad"" reviews. Managers 2 levels about your own, can affect your score. Your individual success is usually at the cost of someone else. You are also penalized if you stay with the same team for more than about 4-5 years. This results in lots of employees transferring around and becoming masters of nothing. I've also worked with the worst managers of any company in my career. Little to nothing is done to remove bad managers either. I've seen a manager fired, and then hired back as a contractor.

The company did it's best to limit the impact on people during each round of restructuring and right-sizing related layoffs, but in the end you an only lose money for so long before things have to change dramtically, including selling company assets and moving employees to Microsoft, or laying people off.

Long story short, because of ALU's soaring costs, the company has suspended raises (even with promotions), given bonuses very sparingly, and reduced benefits (including 401k compensation). This results in overworked and underpaid employees, which dampens company morale and makes the workplace strained.

I do believe the company's cost-cutting measures will result in the ultimate turnaround and ALU will be a successful company: however, that will take a couple of years. The company needs to (and eventually will) learn how to treat its employees better as many left the confusing re-organization structure for better opportunities (myself included).

Your flexibility is a must to these stores, they will want you as early as 6 in the morning and as late as 2 in the morning. However, that does not extend to you getting to be as flexible as you will want to be, especially if you would like to keep the benefits Nordstrom Rack carries. On average you will need to be working 32 hours weekly in order to maintain benefits, yet in the time I spent working, this is much easier said than done. As a full time associate there would be weeks I worked well under the 30 hour mark off-season, while still having to work 5 days a week, it can end up becoming very inconsistent. Managers can also be very inconsistent, especially in terms of communication with each other and the employees. Often putting schedules out with shifts given outside of your availability, or one handling certain store procedures in a wildly different manner than another.

It takes someone who is willing to compete against their peers while being able to maintain strong team cohesiveness. The successful associate needs a strong amount of social intelligence, social finesse, cultural sensitivity, and the ability to provide VIP service. You need to be able to multi-task selling on the sales floor, selling in the fitting room with the customer, ongoing go-backs, on-going floor upkeep, on-going stockroom upkeep, late evening closing and early morning opening. You need to have a polished, professional quality while maintaining authenticity and approachability, making yourself relatable to clients while being assertive enough to tell them your honest opinions. There is no base pay, only a commission structure with a guaranteed hourly rate that is on the low side. I've never had to use my guaranteed hourly rate. Expectations are high, on both the customer side and on the management side. You will grow a lot. You will make more money than any other retail job. But if you can't handle stress or competition, this job is not for you. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you've made someone's day by virtue of your understanding of their needs and by lifting up their spirits.

If you sell $1200 worth of merchandise and up to 1 year later someone decides to return it, even after it has been worn, then you to have to take the return or try to sell them somthing else so you dont lose the commission. I would have customers buy clothes, wear it and bring it back a year later and I would have that commission taken out of my next pay check. You can try to sell them something of equal value or more so you dont lose the $ but a lot of times they will return it in a different department to avoid you and someone else will take the sale. Your first few months you can make good $ but eventually the returns will hit you hard. At least 1/3 of what you sell or more gets returned.

If you are looking to get into management, they promote fast from within, just work hard and sell your best and show interest in management immediately before your returns hit and SPH drops. 3 of the girls that were hired on the same time as me got assistant manager jobs in less than 6months of working there.

Environment can be fun to work in but it can also be catty, especially because it is commission based.
Complaining to management about your poor sales or mass returns won't help you. The outlook is ""well, sell harder, call customers, and build relationships"", sounds like common sense but the returns still make it extremely difficult and stressful. Its an emotional rollercoaster!

But this location has not been that fun. It's filled with a bunch of managers that know what they are doing but have a disrespectful approach to the workers. Our store location recently changed the way our team works and a lot of us workers had something to say about it. They could care less what we have to say about it and they always have an excuse as to why something is the way it is instead of just admitting their wrong. The hardest part is biting your tongue because anything you say or do will have an immediate effect on your hours. If you don't have completely open availability you could literally be scheduled for 40 hours one week and 10 hours the next which is very unstable. I found myself having to get a second and third job during the school year because I have rent and things like that to pay. You need a lot of patience, management wise and customer wise. At the end of the day just push through because you can't beat the pay. Starting is 11.00 and every 1000 hours you work you get a raise.

The managers are never on the same page. One day they will say one thing, and another they will say something entirely different. The kool-aid drinking is also extreme in this store, and if you are not living and breathing Nordstrom than you don't fit in.

The positives are that everyone is usually in a good mood despite this. Most of the employees do not drink the kool-aid thankfully, and those that do are easily tuned out.

For starters as a sales associate, the way you earn your money is through commission. There is no doubt you have to be driven to work there, because that is the only way you can make some money. The hours get tough since you want to make money the busiest times are through out the weekends. You find yourself always working and never really having a weekend to yourself. Once you get into management is get tricky because you do get a salary, but in order to make that sale you always have to earn commission. So now you have to multitask with multiple departments, make sure your teams are driven, and passionate people, and attend to everyone's needs especially the costumer. Once all of that is done you need to focus on your own selling time, so you can make money and ensure your departments reach their goals. I learned that I can do about ten things at once, and how to really manage my time in the workplace. The most important thing with any job, is finding some balance. Between not having a set schedule, working every weekend, and working some nights it was hard to keep a balanced life.

The managers will overwork you. You will sell a lot of product but what is not told in your interview is that a lot of that product you sell will come back in returns. That affects you. You could sell 15,000 in a pay period and receive 1,500 in commission but much of that will come back in returns and bite you in the butt in your upcoming paychecks. For example this pay period I sold 13,000 of product and over 4,500 of that product from that pay period has come back in returns. So I am starting this next pay period basically owning the store the commission I have lost.

Another HUGE downfall is that whatever you make in minimum wage is subtracted from your earnings in commissions. This is a big deal breaker and a LOT of people quit after they find this out. Nordstrom will NOT tell you this, you have to figure it out in your first paycheck. For example if you make 750 in your hourly wage and 1,500 in commissions, the 750 will be subtracted from your 1,500 in commissions leaving your paycheck at 750 even. This guarantees your hourly wage which is the law, but it takes a lot out of the commission which is a big downfall and disappointing when you work so hard.A Big Disappointment",1,1,3,1.0,0,3,0,0,0.0,1,0,2,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,0,0.0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,0.0,1,0.076,0.889,0.035,0.0,1.0,0.0,-0.020499999999999997

I also clean the department and prepare for store opening. Throughout the day I am customer servicing each individual customer helping them with whatever they may need. From putting together a baby shower gift, to outfitting their children in the latest merchandise. I also am required to take returns, help with gift cards sales and payments. We are also individually required to do daily floor tasks and stock assignments along with meeting the selling goal. Educating customers on the benefits of opening a Nordstrom retail or debit card as well as our new rewards card. All things to help further benefit the customers shopping experience.

The one thing I've learned is that growing with the company is completely up to you. If you want to grow with the company you have to ask question regarding it or it will be given to someone else if you don't show interest. Management will never approach you and offer you a promotion, which usually goes to their favorites anyway.

Co-workers are great. I would say there will be 95% of the co-workers you're like and about 5% who you won't have anything to do with because either you don't get them, like them, or feel their just troubled.

The high pace of work combined with good hours made it an enjoyable and challenging job without being daunting or draining. The staff were wonderful- each and every one of my managers (and there were several) were supportive and positive, and were very patient as I learned the complicated (but thorough and precise) register system.

I also appreciated the benefits, and how thoroughly the company takes care of their employees- from the basics (insurance, medical leave, etc.) to the unusual (Future Nordstrom Leaders mentorship program). It goes to show that the company really puts stock into the people that they hire.

The hard part of the job was when the pace began to slow down after the holidays; It was extremely difficult (and often impossible) to meet quota with how little traffic we would get on a daily basis. As well, on occasion it's difficult to sell products that seem overpriced (although the quality of the product was higher.)

I enjoyed working in sales there because of the wide variety of interesting customers, and I loved my coworkers and manager - they made it fun to show up to work every day. Working in sales at Nordstrom involves being on your feet constantly, and can be physically exhausting due to the many mandatory tasks other than selling such as restocking, cleaning, rearranging displays, answering phones (often customer service related,) and, of course, doing returns. There is no time to stand around idle, but if you work hard, make sales your priority, have a good rapport with customers so as to develop a good personal clientele, and don't get too many returns against you, it is possible to earn anywhere from $15.00 to $30.00+ per hour.. Yes, the returns get frustrating because you are working on a commission basis - especially if it is one of your own customers. It's hard to lose the commission on a good sale that you invested a lot of time and effort in, but you have to just smile and try to look forward and hope you can make it up on a new sale. During the years I worked there I witnessed almost every salesperson break down in tears at one time or another when they found out about returns against them (hard to pay rent when you don't make money) and promised I would never let it get to me like that ... but it does.

Management, however, is misaligned.

We never tell the customer no. While this might be annoying to you as customers take advantage and walk all over you...you basically will never have to deal with irate customers.

Cons:
Its hard to reach the 1,000 hour minimum (in order to get PTO and benefits and higher base rate) when as a ""full-time"" employee you're scheduled less than 30 hours a week. Also, HR doesn't care that you're full-time and they'll push your department manager to cut hours as much as possible even if that means your whole ""full-time"" team will be working on ""part-time"" hours.

Clean, straighten and sell.

What I learned:
Be careful who you talk to and keep talking to a minimum if you want to make more sales.

Management:
Be weary. They are your boss, not your friend and do not accept their responsibilities as your own. You do not receive compensation for completing their duties.

Co-workers:
Be kind and helpful but not too helpful. Do not divulge too much about yourself. Keep the chatter at a minimum if you want to make money.

Hardest part of the job:
Making money.

The relationships you get to create with your customers and the service you can offer is truely remarkable. Also the people that work for the company are the best thing that you can hope for in a job. They really are like a family and that is what keeps most employees there at least in my experience. The tricky part about working for this company is that Nordstrom gives its employees and managers the freedom to ""use your best judgment"" reguarding any difficult situation that you come across. That being said, the company gives alot of freedom to management to decide what they think is ok and whats crossing a line so every single manager has a different idea of how things should be. this can make working for managers there incredibly difficult. And because Nordstrom has such an entrepenure spirit about it, there are a ton of bias involved in who moves up and who gets demoted/fired in the company. You can be a top seller and work for the company for years but one day if a manger decides they don't like you anymore they can find a reason to fire you or keep you in your spot so you cant move up and thats it. I've seen it happen numerious times. and HR does nothing to help support the employees, they are there to protect the company that is all.

I found I was particularly good with outfitting professionals with a several outfits, including accessories and shoes.

Typically, my day would start with putting out new merchandise which arrived daily. Many times I would call customers I had a rapport with, if I felt that something arrived that was a ""must have"". I would do the details of the day, which, included getting alterations and calling those customers. Making sure the department had the tools necessary--bags, register tape, garment bags, etc. I was considered by many to be reliable and dependable by management and was not given a lot of supervision.

Great people, believe in the concept of teams and working hard. Never saw an issue is recognition of success and there are plenty of challenges to help you keep growing in the business.
Cons
Benefits are not that great. Sometimes they play favorites, session planning seems to be a topic of an issue here. They can really work on this more.
Advice to Management
Look for your diamonds in the rough because those are your future leaders of the company.

The sales side of the company is extremely competitive and tends to lean more on the unethical and questionable side. You'll spend more time competing with other sales teams for Oracle products than actually competing with external forces. The comp structure on the sales side is crazy, but don't don't expect a solid base pay. Currently there is excessive pressure to push cloud services and cloud credits on customers. If you fight for your customer's best interests, you may get into trouble, so be careful.

The consulting side of the company is extremely understaffed, under trained, and stretched very thin. The higher up you climb in the consulting side, you more customers and products you'll have to cover. You'll spend most of your time either in pre-sales consulting support or post-sales janitor duty. A lot of consulting gigs at Oracle are horribly mismanaged and at the behest of the sales team to clean up after their poor judgement on solution positioning or on the customers dime to fix their mistakes.

Getting good management can make or break your experience but I got lucky on the apps side. Oracle does like to promote from within, but it's kind of a popularity contest so network from day 1. Oracle Direct only promotes within sales though; it's really hard to make a lateral move within the company.

I find the culture of the company to be rather negative at first, as if the culture of the company was to hate the company. It creates camaraderie among employees in a weird way though.

The peer staff are great, knowledgeable, friendly people; however, you barely get to interact with them and learn well - a big disappointment.

As a Lead Agent....
This company lets you be a Realtor, where competitors take take take. This is a FULL time career. Many many clients, many many deals. No farming clients.

With the average agent completing average of 36 deals a year you have the ability to learn faster than the competition.

Once you have a small amount of experience you get a transaction coordinator to help you with the volume while you maintain your relationship. Most lead agents earning $85k-$130k yearly.

Vacations are time off are offered but you don't actually get to shut down. You are still expected to take calls from your clients and work during your time off. If you are in a market that is slow then so is your pay. Smaller markets don't get the same amount of support from home office as the larger offices and you can feel very isolated.
The company has a great concept for customer service but they don't have the same commitment to the Realtors in the field that generate almost ALL of the income for the company.

If you are an associate agent (a contractor) you are guilty of anything an agent deems in their own mind as wrong. No chance to debate or make a case. You are wrong, say sorry I will do better and move on. Even if they attack your character on a personal level and deem you a liar or irresponsible without proof or an investigation. Stand up for yourself and your contract is immediately ended. Listing agents have inaccurate listings that when pointed out do not correct. (Ethics violation). Instructions for AA's are missing or incorrect and the expectation from agent to agent various tremendously. Some want more, some less. It is not the Redfin way but the way of that particular agent.

The hardest parts of working at Redfin include being at the whim of a turbulent real estate market and having to fight for resources sometimes makes it hard to get things done.Not a Real Estate Company",1,1,1,0.0,0,1,0,0,1.0,0,0,1,0.0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,0.0,1,0.039,0.829,0.132,1.0,0.0,0.0,-0.45349999999999996

Agents are paid based on reviews and sometimes regardless of how hard you work, you're not compensated regardless of the hard work you did. They claim paid benefits and dues, however your base salary is so menial along with bonus structure, you indeed are paying for all of those benefits they claim to offer. If you are a RE Agent and want unlimited earning potential, don't work at this place. If you're a brand new Agent with no experience, Redfin is a great place to start because they'll provide enough leads to keep you stressed out and under water. You will be expected to close a minimum of 3 deals per month, so forget any kind of work life balance. If you attempt to take a day off to decompress, you will be scolded and told you're not a team player. Also, given your compensation is tied to a review by the customer, you better be prepared to miss out on quiet time, family time, or even the birth of your children, because rest assure some consumer will claim in a review that you didn't respond to them in a timely manner and your already menial bonus will be cut further. The Average bonus after taxes is $1,000.00 and your base salary will be $10,000.00 so you do the math. A traditional Agent will be paid thousands in commissions, paid right away, and paid regardless of what the consumer thinks.

Due to the nature of the company, being one of the largest and greatest in the sustainable energy field (which is actually the primary basis of the company with automobiles being a secondary component), its a great place to work if you like to be on the cutting edge. The company offers a lot to its employees, which is amazing, including paid time off, flexible hours and locations, and great management (depending upon timing and location) but it does have some things to learn. For example, management is there for when you need them, but sometimes its hard for them to get back to you when you directly need them. You have more than enough training, and people who are willing to help you with any of the company's products, but to get a decision from direct management can be difficult. But communication is good between branches, and employees, and the lifestyle is great to sell as it sells itself. For a car guy like me, working with the greatest automotive product since the Model T is simply the coolest idea, and beats any of the negatives about this job, which are few, but there are some.

Guaranteed Earnings are one of the only ways to make real money and it usually doesn't work out. Management is not helpful and restaurants are often outright rude. Compared to other delivery companies Uber has nothing special to offer, the most basic one available and I do not recommend working there. While the delivery side of the job is easy enough to imagine if one is willing or not but the app used for Uber drivers crashes almost on every delivery, mixes the phone numbers of restaurants and customers, the power bank provided by the company charged my phone about 50% over a day and though the gear is sent through the mail and a 75 euro deposit is taken from you, I had to return it in another city when I finally decided to work somewhere else. Limited or no discounts are available to you compared to other places and many of my problems with the app for example were dismissed when contacting help. Last thing: Uber is the only delivery place which employs drivers in Winter and gives them a company t-shirt; any other company would provide a jacket or something that isn't a joke.

When I was there. There was no QA and phone calls are still not recorded cause all you do is transfer calls. No help support of real info is traded. Just transfer and set up phone appointments.

ZIllow has a great culture and is full of amazing and intelligent people. If you want to work in a tech job with great work/life balance, amazing benefits, while surrounded by smart people, you should work at Zillow.

Hardest Part: The technical challenges. I think this should be the hardest part, because you aren't learning anything otherwise.

Most Enjoyable: Free lunches, co-workers, solving challenging problems.

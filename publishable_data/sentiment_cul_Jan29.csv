Come in, log into system, get right to work gathering products to fulfill customer orders. Help coworkers with hard-to-find items or missing/damaged items.

What I learned:
Work as hard as I can, always be ready to assist the team, keep open communication with management. Don't let any of them abuse their position to make your job harder than it should be.

Management:
The two direct supervisors I worked closest with during my time at Google Express were both very easy-going and hands-off. As long as I got my work done and kept an open line of communication to assist with any complications that might come up, they just left me to my work. Now the other managers and district managers were an entirely different story. They were entirely unwilling to help with anything--whether it be scheduling, points on our records, or just being generally civil, they consistently talked down to and looked down on us. They would ask for our input on streamlining parts of the work process, and proceed not to listen to any of our ideas, until parts of the work programs malfunctioned, or our order queue skyrocketed for weeks at a time.

Workplace culture:
Aside from the aforementioned management problems, coworkers were, for the most part, easy to get along with, and reliable to work with. However, as is the case in most work environments, there were a handful of extremely lazy people. This would not be a problem if it weren't for the fact that the team as a whole works towards fulfilling a total quota for the day.

There are certain perks and company functions you're not allowed to enjoy, but the biggest caution is that Google is only allowed to keep a temp on for two years. If your contract is renewed after the first year, great. But if they don't hire you on as permanent by the time the second year comes around, start looking for a new gig. In theory, you can be re-hired as a TVC if you are out of the company for a minimum of three months, but I've never seen that happen.

Good people on the ground floor meaning the heart and soul of the respective sales team

Cons

In a phrase, the company is the ""DMV of Media Companies"".
They infantilize their sales teams with silly trainings and sales tactics that do not help in the field.
Between call blitzes and micro management by managers they create a very combative sales culture.
Managers set expectations and unrealistic goals that no one meets in the organization.
Nepotism and discriminatory favoritism are common place at ReachLocal.

What makes Google fantastic are the people, who are some of the smartest and most interesting you will encounter. However, job satisfaction depends largely on the team that you are in and the management that you are under. Some teams, such as Sales or Acquisitions, have a great deal of mindless administrative work which can be very frustrating. Also work-life balance in Sales is poor, and the wages are not high enough to compensate for this.

The company has begun branching out in the types of services they offer consumers with their recent purchase of Squaretrade. They need to do more of this since the old business model of auto insurance will soon go to the wayside when driver-less cars come online. Allstate is very slow to change, and upper management talks a lot about Allstate being a ""family"" and being ""a force for good"" in the community. Really what they are concerned about is driving their stock price higher for the shareholders, and they are not afraid to lay people off to achieve this goal. Recently about 600 claims adjusters were laid off when Allstate decided to automate their job functions with Quick Photo Claim self-service claims mobile app. This has the policyholder taking a picture of their auto damage through a mobile app instead of having a professional claims adjuster look at the vehicle. The company has also let people go as they continue to outsource jobs to India and the UK. There has been talk that they may close the Northbrook office and utilize remote office hubs instead, but these are just rumors. The lack of transparency on the part of upper management regarding this is causing morale to plummet depending on your role with the company.

In the Sacramento area you will make more $$ and have more demographic clientele.Agent was a New agent, organized, competitive pay $14 and hour (in 2006) and nice person overall. So I moved to San Joaquin area, took another for another agent and within 6 months out of business pay was no where near comparable, no clientele . Business closed of OUT of work again. Then another New agent in Tracy hired me as an LSP and was not a great experience either. She was hardly at the office, always paid us 3 to 4 days late, had a camera installed behind us and when a customer came in she turned it on to hear what we were talking about. In the middle of dealing with client she would text us to see how it was going. Pay was a real joke in the area you will expect to make with your California insurance license (P&C) between $10 - $14 and hour, commission varies by agent but is not much on a policy. Policies usually pay $5 homeowners and auto $10-$35 commission. MY ADVICE: Find an agent that has been in business for more that 2 years that way they will have already passed the Series 6&63. If the agents don't pass Series 6&63 then, Allstate will come in and close them down. Leaving you with no job and unemployment will not pay enough to cover.

Upper management tells you that you are part of a family and your manager is really a leader to help you become successful. They constantly tell you they will not let you fail. That was not my experience or the experience of other new comers. They do not provide adequate training. They throw you out into the field and expect you to succeed. While they do encourage you to reach out to people and experienced adjusters are very helpful... there is way to much that the job encompasses to be successful in this role. Everyone I have every spoken to is over worked and undervalued. There has been a high amount of turn over and for good reason. Employees take a survey about upper management. The trends of no work life balance unhappy employees are constant but management will not do anything with the feedback they receive. If in a field role you do get 4 weeks of vacation but you cannot get the dates you want if a seasoned adjuster picks that time first. Overall, my experience was a very negative one.

Working with the team leads was a different story. Filing claims we are supposed to do what is right for the customer. One call is to take care of a great deal of the problems. However it is a call center and one of the biggest issues is call volume. The problem here is you can't do you both and you're held accountable either way. Have a high time your away from the phone trying to get a manager, trying to assist a customer, or agent? Doesn't matter, that time was spent where you could have taken another call. Resolving calls too fast or meeting your numbers? Well, your in trouble there because you may not have resolved the call.

When the team leads would come to talk to me and other team members, they were extremely condescending and rude. Again, it was that exaggerated positive attitude which came off offensive.

Pros: Friendly, non-stressful workplace with easy hours. Great benefits and corporate headquarters has nice perks. The LDP program offers a lot of resources and opportunity straight out of undergrad. The starting salary for the LDP program is good but Allstate's compensation is not competitive after 2-3 years.

Cons: Mostly mediocre business environment-some areas foster top talent and offer challenging work. However, too much of the company's workforce is unimaginative, conservative. Long-timers are simply keeping their cubicles warm until pension time. Location is 30 miles outside of Chicago, a long commute for those of us who live in the city.

After making low pay and excellent metrics for 3 years I began to wonder how true this promise of upward mobility was.

Line level managers are slaves who give up their lives to senior managers who treat lower managers as if they have no life other than work.

Very political to get promoted, meet a category, or completely sacrifice your life to devote to your manager's success to get advanced. Manage by fear of you losing your job. My group of 30 has had 25 people quit in the last 12 months. Internal transfers are not allowed for heavy results producers. Once you are labeled a work horse, you are stuck in that job unless you really brown nose managers to allow you to transfer. Or really suck up to your manager.

All the negative of Steve Job's reign exist - micromanagement by design to ensure that managers know what is going on if people quit; poor treatment of managers by senior managers because we pay you to put up with it; and, without Jobs to hammer on senior managers, no one in the C-suite tells them what to do. Management reviews poor management surveys and (a) blames the questions for being misleading (b) blames the employees for not trying hard enough. C-suite does not direct Business Unit managers to meet budgets/manage issues. Instead, line level operations staff are thrown at business units to attack spending habits.

Culture - a mixture of new folks (less than 18months) who are hopeful in their career at Apple, accepting of their fate folks who have learned, jaded folks who make the system work for them while protecting their job.

The weekends and busy time around holidays get old, but the benefits really make up for it. The benefits are amazing. They are so comfortable that it makes it hard to leave when it's time to leave.

Stick it out, and you'll eventually get it in many cases, but it might take serious tenacity and time. There are some exceptions, but they are rare.

Development is a commitment by leaders. Sometimes it is not as good as other times. Some leaders are better at it that others, but it is a part of the culture, which is great. If you're self motivated and take ownership, you'll develop and grow. If you think your development is someone else's job, you will be frustrated on occasion.

Learn as much as you can at work, there is so much to learn! Then take you benefits and go learn at school or elsewhere. So many people don't use their benefits in education. It's free money people, even if you can only spend it by studying and learning, it's worth it.

If you don't like people and your skin is not too thick. Go do something else. Otherwise, it's a pretty fun gig, but it's not designed to be permanent for most people. Always be making 2 plans - development for internal promotion and development for external opportunities.

The culture is great and you feel like the people around you care for you. I went further into the technical side of Apple by going in to the family room. I started by talking to people about their issues with their iOS devices. I switch markets when I moved to Colorado Springs, CO. The culture changes from different markets primarily due to store volume. The small the store the closer you feel to the people you work with. The larger the more overwhelming in can be. I moved back to Austin, TX and became a genius. The new store I'm in is different than Colorado because its more volume but we still kept our culture.

All of the benefits we have, ranging from health to simple discounts really make it worth wild.

Typical day is like any retail sales, but it's very low key how you interact with customers. Genuinely answer customers questions, find their needs and wants, and offer a solution. Many times it's just talking to someone about your own personal user experiences. No hard selling or trying to make quotas. If you are stumped, just be honest and find a colleague who may be able to help. Generally conversation is not very ""tech"" based--it's good to know what is in the machine, but most solutions will revolve around more with how it helps a user. Practically any time you want training on a product, you can ask to leave the floor and watch online videos on the clock.

You don't need to be that techie to get hired--honestly, during the group interview, the folks that seemed to only ooze tech never got hired. You don't even have to be an Apple user! Being creative in some way probably is very helpful. Once on board, there is a two-day training to solidly get you up to speed. It's focused, but pretty fun as you interact with your future team members. (Out of all the retail jobs I've had, only two of them did very concise and thorough multi-day trainings before you even step onto the sales floor--Apple Store and Whole Foods.)

Management at our store was great, but your mileage may vary. But they do seem to attract and hire some of the best retail managers overall.

However, as a contractor, I have no paid holidays, no PTO, and only 3 sick days for the entire year, and that was not the case when I had started. This particularly becomes a problem in calendar Q4 when Tim is generous to the employees w/ holidays, but I have no way to compensate for the lack of pay during Thanksgiving week and the Christmas-New Years shut down. The other issue is the 15-18 month limit on contractors, so if you aren't converted after that, you have to leave for a few months before you can come back, which is not practical. Lastly, as a contractor, I feel like a second class citizen in the company -- there are many moments when it becomes painfully obvious you are not a regular employee.

Aside from those sticking points, I think the company culture is great, the regular employees seem to have great benefits, and it is genuinely a diverse workplace -- at least in my building, I have bumped into all sorts of nationalities, ethnicities, religions, orientations, persons with disabilities, etc...

I feel as a sales associate I have grown greatly.
Within the retail stores there are only so many positions available to grow towards and unless you wish to become a genius or technician its easy to plateau.
Apple hires incredible people, the stores have an incredible culture and you work with people that you can easily call family, the pay is competitive when looking at compensation in similar jobs, however the pay increase of those that stay with the company longer periods of time seem unfair. someone that has been employed at the retail store 10 years is getting paid at what I started. I personally am not able to live off of my income comfortably and working 9 hour shifts 5 days a week, I shouldn't have to say that. Apple is also a company that listens to its employees and open to our opinions on how things are working and how things aren't working.

At apple you learn everyday, but what they can't teach you is the experience with your customer, when you start asking them questions and talking about their personal life and what brought them to apple, and you will always hear a story that somehow will remind you of yourself.

The diversity at apple is amazing, you also get to learn things from your peers and management beside the apple culture and basics, i like to say, apple is its own community, and just like all communities have their flaws so does apple, but again that is a opportunity.

I personally learned a lot working at the AppleStore, but unfortunately missed the chance to get into management, and advancement had become glacial.

The culture has changed significantly based on feedback from other current and many recently former Apple employees. Management is more apt for hiring large amount of contractors which dwarf actual Apple employees and then revolve the door each year.

Getting a permanent position with Apple is very difficult and political. As a contractor, you will meet a lot of great people who do very good work, yet Apple could care less about their contract position as the months roll by.

Currently going into 9 months as a contractor and out of my initial class of 25+, there are about 5-6 of us still hanging around. Talking with other groups who numbered around 50-60 6 months ago, and they are now sporting around 15-20.

You will hear supervisors talk about former contractors who did really well, go to team meetings and hear how happy management is with random fluff, but at the end of the day it doesn't mean diddly for contractors.

My recommendation, come in with the idea your going to learn as much as you can and then move on to a company that actually wants you.

Recommendation to Apple Executives and Management:

Your reputation as a company is already faltering in many arenas as word of mouth spreads. Treat people like human beings and hire your contractors who learn their jobs well and are with you for 5-6+ months instead of treating them like a revolving door which Apple has gainedNot for hard workers",0,2,3,0.0,1,2,1,0,0.0,0,0,2,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,1,3,0,2,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,0.0,1,0.017,0.886,0.097,0.5,0.5,0.0,-0.21000000000000002

Learning how the retail culture functions and how to manage people was definitely a plus. Management was very helpful and very supportive. Part of the reason why many of us worked there was because of such a diverse group to work with. One of the hardest things to adjust to was the loud noise all the time.

After hearing about goals and new store initiaitives, we would hit the floor and immediately start selling all day. Along with selling, we would inform and educate other users of Apple products about how to best use their devices that best fits their lives and intrests.

What I learned: I learned how to be patient and ask the right questions at the right time. Another trait that was strengthened was the ability to listen and listen well. Really finding out what the client needed and why they needed that was the most successfull thing I learned while at Apple. I learned how to work as a team to achieve lofty sales goals within the team of Experts. I also learned how to communicate effectively with people from all walks of life. From teenages to the edlerly, I can do it all.

Management: The management team at Apple is extensive and diverse. I found that there were some managers that made things happen and others that did not. I hung on to the ones that made things happen. Management was very clear on how to attain various goals that the employee wanted to attain.

Hardest part of the job: Feeling taken advantage of on a daily basis by clients who took no initiave whatsoever to take time and learn their new products before entering the store.

Most enjoybale part: Interacting face to face with hundreds of people day in and day out. With that, entering transactions that turned into transformations were a key area that I easily fell in love with.One of a kind culture with one of a kind people.",0,3,4,1.0,1,5,0,0,1.0,0,0,4,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,5,0,3,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,1,0.007,0.865,0.127,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.56

This is one of the most sought after companies to work for and there is good reason: Apple understands vision more than most.

Apple retail does not feel like typical retail. The only thing that feels remotely retail is the schedule. The schedule does not meet my definition of work/life balance. I enjoy the work tremendously including the people I work with. If you are considering Apple retail, understand what you are signing up for. There are NO set days off--it's retail. If you accept this, then you will be fine. If your gut tells you otherwise, then pursue something else.

There is no typical day at work. Everyday is different. There are consistent responsibilities, but within each responsibility there arises new problems that force me to exercise skills that I don't normally use outside of work. I am extremely thankful of the experience.

One of the most rewarding parts of the job is working with incredible talent. Apple pride's itself with hiring the best. This is generally true. Not only have I worked with incredibly talented and smart people, I can honestly say that I have made some lifelong friends. Apple lends itself to making great friends and professional partners.

Unfortunately, Apple does not treat its employees anywhere near as well as it does its customers. For part-time work they pay isn't bad, but if you work full-time you don't get paid enough to live on, unless you're a manager. This is exacerbated by the fact that the commitment demanded precludes you from taking a second job to make ends meet. You either commit totally to Apple, or you don't work full-time.

You also have to deal with management that is frequently inept and petty. They get focused on managing the names on the iPads they constantly have with them on the floor, and do little to nothing to connect to the people attached to those names. You're not a person, you're a cog in their machine. And God forbid you should say or do something they don't like because managers will make your life hell to force you to quit if you look at them crosswise. I actually saw them take a number one salesperson and make life humiliating and miserable in an effort to make that employee quit.

If you work in Apple Retail, your fellow employees are smart and committed, but thanks to the management, you have to constantly watch your back.

If you think you can start part-time and move up, find a different career. Management does nothing to support you in moving up and they never suggest you try for a move.

The outward indications can be seen in the stock price and offering dividends (a fully different direction). Internally, the management philosophy has changed from grow, develop, and retain world-class talent to pinch pennies for the quarterly earnings calls.

An example would be cutting the Apple iWalk (a 5-K walk to promote health and well-being for employees. When asked, HR noted that people don't quit over losing the iWalk. True, but the philosophy behind the cutting / trimming changes Apple's culture from quirky entrepreneurialism to corporate bottom-liners.

The work-life balance described is not as advertised. Compensation for weekends and late nights (weeks at a time) worked was not forth-coming, rather vacation requests were questioned and cheering on a child's baseball game at 8pm was considered dangerous for a career.

Finally, management regularly herald that they pay 80% of market due to the panache and prestige of working for Apple. Perhaps, but many good people were leaving Apple as I made my decision to leave. Their stories weren’t different than mine – that the change in leadership (CEO down to middle management) dampened their initiative and excitement for the job.

Management is very easy to work with and they will go out of their way to accomodate you. At the same time a lot is expected. Management has their favorites and it shows. Management also gives you a lot of free reign to handle customers in whatever way you see fit. You are not a robot therefore some decisions are up to you.

You are on your feet the whole day and if you are full-time this will begin to hurt after a while. Some days are very hectic and will be very stressful. As with any retail store the holiday season will be VERY stressful.

Apple is a great company full of gems as far as programmers, products, people, and brand are concerned. There is no reason whatsoever to get caught up in other brands, or companies while there. For this reason, Apple's singular vision to give everything technology, electronic, and cool an Apple stamp is great, if not slightly less ambitious than their rivals.

My advice: drink the punch--deep. Don't be fooled by friends, or other pursuits who sway you away from the company line.

I think it comes down to the individual, your drivers, where you're at in you personal life, and where you want to go with your career. I'm thankful for the quality of home life it's afforded me, but not the emotional toll it has taken.
And now that I'm later in career, I've even been told by mgmt lately that they were ""looking for someone earlier in career."" (yeah, I know, HR would be all over that one!).

Leadership focus is on metrics and speed of delivery. Quality relationships and team building are thrown out the window when the metrics aren't being met.

There's also no focus on career building. If I hear ""you own your career"" one more time....sigh. The quandary is, you get told that, then when you take ownership, you hear things like ""this is where we see your career going."" Which is ultimately a play to fill a gap that exists in that moment within a department's need.

The work/life balance is great for parents, and there is virtually zero pressure to complete work on-time or ""correctly."" Since the culture of the company skews older, many managers are empathetic to last-minute PTO requests, and extensions on deadlines are always viable. This means that there is no expectation to ""crunch,"" which can be a great relief to anyone who's about to burnout from the fast-paced software industry.

Unfortunately, these cultural values come at a cost. The company operates at a painfully slow pace, as there is no incentive to address issues as they arise. Sometimes the engineer that is blocking you is on PTO for a week or is a contractor overseas that only answers emails 9-5, their time.

This notion of how well a company is performing affects the employees currently working for Cisco as well as potential new hires. If you are looking for a job, landing employment is a good thing. There's lots to learn and plenty of opportunities to move around. The only problem is moving up and growth as an individual.

2190,2992,355,cmp-review-63ca73b6d3988b8d,Cisco,"From my experience, there are two main items to keep in mind:

1. Your manager is going to have a lot to do with your comfort at Cisco. I happened to love both of my managers but your mileage here may vary. There is no single management school or track that managers at Cisco go on so you can get a fantastic manager or a terrible one and it has nothing to do with Cisco.

2. Generally the benefits are better and the pay is better at Cisco. Also, you can work remotely. This covers up for a lot of other things missing from other companies. This is *not* a place that does perks like ergonomic desks or company parties.


After that, the most important aspect of my work here is that you are not being babysat. If you are not a self-starter who self-manages, it's hard to function here. This was both good and bad:

Good: You are being treated like a professional and an adult. You work on your own project on your own time and you can come in at 4 in the morning -- they don't seem to care. You can also generally work remotely from home, a coffee shop, or the North Atlantic. It's getting things done not getting-things-done-while-wearing-the-correct-outfit.

Bad: It's hard to tell what's going on behind the scenes, with leadership, even in the cube next to yours. There's a hardcore engineer-style DIY culture here where you're supposed to just figure it out. That can be very frustrating if you need to get something done and don't know how or who handles it. It's also easy to go a little crazy when you don't know whether your project is going well or poorly.

Instead, Cisco has focused more and more on Wall Street performance in recent years, rewarding executives, but stripping these acquired companies of critical performers, continuing to reduce the amount of expertise on staff in favor of less experienced and temporary contract labor that reduces short term OpEx. This results in more people taking longer to accomplish what was once done by fewer people in shorter time frames, often forcing Cisco to over-promise and under-deliver.

While the Cisco UCS data center platform was likely one of the best investments Cisco has made in recent years, Cisco was still late into Video & Content, late into Virtualization and Cloud Computing, and late into Big Data & Analytics.

If Cisco would concentrate a little less on short term market performance and could listen to its customers more and listen to the companies it acquires more rather than dismissing the experts and critical, strategic thinkers that made them successful and a target for Cisco acquisition in the first place, it would likely find that its market performance would take care of itself.

Change, at an ever increasing pace, is simply a mainstay of the culture at Cisco. It is very common to hear the phrase “The only thing constant at Cisco is change.” Successful Cisco employees embrace this part of the culture and thrive on learning new things and leading the global IT industry on a great number of fronts. The people I worked with at Cisco are very talented, intelligent, focused, warm, honest, and extremely supportive. Many of them will remain lifelong associates and friends.

The hardest part of working at Cisco was staying connected to all of the fascinating technology and business impacting advancements that were (and still are) being developed, all over the globe, at an ever increasing pace. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of working at Cisco was being able to leverage those advancements to make a positive impact on the business of the partners and customer with which I worked. Many companies, and individual business leaders, expect Cisco to be the global leader in IT and they have grown to trust that Cisco will deliver the right solutions to meet their pressing business needs. As an employee, it was rewarding to represent that level of achievement by Cisco. Each day I remained invigorated as I worked to earn and grow that elevated level of trust with my partners and customers.

My co-workers were the best. We still have dinner together.

Working at Dell is both satisfying and extremely stressful. If a person stays at Dell long enough and leaves the company that person can create a Post Dell Traumatic Syndrome. (PDTS).

However, there are many great things about Dell. There is a corporate shutdown for the week of Christmas that is a paid holiday. The PBA time is great, the vacation days are great.

The only downside to Dell, at least the division I work in, would be the compensation packages and the salary. I wont mention any specific numbers, but in my eyes, my salary plus compensation package does not equal what a Sales Engineer should be making even at just base salary with no compensation.

Most managers could not do the work they are tasked with managing...therefore they have no depth of understanding and their demands are merely bullets from a PowerPoint slide they presented to their own management. They're get 'er done mentality without a fundamental understanding of the technology or process results in stress and ultimately job dissatisfaction for those reporting to a management structure that's primarily about politics and perception management/manipulation rather than technical and process execution. It is sad, but Dell suffers from a management culture that is as dysfunctional as they come. This might be a good place add to your resume...but don't make the mistake that you can come into the org now and have a successful career. The management hierarchy is well entrenched and they lay people off frequently...and they take issue with anyone that suggests there is a better way.

Staff is guilted/forced into mandetory overtime and threatened with repercussions if non compliance. Leadership refuses sick days.
Very very little training before going live and very often will agents lose access to required applications and deemed responsible for it. On call leadership to verify high priority information doesnt answer. Which you will also be reprimanded for.

Compensation is decent, but advancement in the company is mired in red tape. After applying to a job on their internal site, I was told that I wouldn't be considered for a position because the pay disparity between the position I was in and the position I was applying for was too great. I was more than qualified for the position in every other way. My HR rep went as far as to suggest my leaving the company and reapplying after 9 months for the position I wanted as being an alternative.

After working at Dell for several years without meaningful increase in my compensation due to several company-wide hiring/raise freezes which always seemed to correspond to our team's end of year reviews, I was laid off because much of my team's job functions had been ported to agencies in the US, China, and India.

I tried Dell again and worked as a contractor nine months later, with the hopes that I'd be hired on permanently. Within 11 months the entire team I was on was laid off because they decided to take the functions and practices we designed for them and port them to a team in India.

Management changes frequently and the company re-organizes at least twice a year. There are at least 2 layoffs a year. With all of these external things going on it makes it extremely difficult for employees to focus on their jobs and responsibilities.

3081,3915,816,cmp-review-479bcc073117d37a,Dell,"EMC is a good place to be a young professional, and makes a good first job. For starters, the company likes to hire young folks and has many resources for individuals trying to improve their skills and learn how to conduct themselves in a business environment. If you prove yourself in the first couple years, you can expect to be rewarded. If you've got a good manager and stick with them, you have the potential to build a great reputation among your peers.

Counter-intuitive as it may be, if you want to move up at EMC, sometimes it is a lot better if you look elsewhere and come back at some point in the future. There are a lot of entrenched interests at EMC, especially in the legacy product groups. It can be difficult to break through them. Sometimes being incredibly competent just isn't enough.

Sometimes the management can also be short-sighted. The obsession with setting and meeting deadlines at all costs (essentially, with being the first to market) can sometimes lead to problematic product releases.

That said, I've learned so much while at EMC. My manager is the best I ever could have hoped for, my co-workers are great to work with, and I really feel like the high-pressure, fast-paced, competitive work environment I've been exposed to over the past several years has made me a lot tougher than I'd expected to be at this point. I've had some failures and some successes but if you take responsibility for your mistakes and keep improving, management sees that and responds to it favorably.Very Competitive Environment - Great to Cut Your Teeth On!",0,4,5,0.0,0,3,0,0,0.0,0,1,4,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,1,4,0,4,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,1,0.049,0.793,0.158,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0545

Management: I had three separate managers while at EMC. It is rather difficult to be a Field Service Manager as you are on point for any and all major escalations and problems that customers encounter, additionally the structure of the Global Services branch changes almost yearly and creates a shuffling and re-branding of manpower.

The hardest part of the job is the extremely fast paced environment, most of the maintenance is reactive, and isn't scheduled until a few hours prior to your scheduled arrival. Also trying to engage lab support, you will spend a minimum of two hours waiting for the initial diagnosis by most of the labs, and then an additional few hours waiting for a solution or potential part that is selected for replacement.

Good work-life balance. Ability to work from home at times. Ability to create your own schedule to a certain degree.

Pays better than almost any other employer in town.

And a very collaborative environment - consulting colleagues and forming cross-functional teams encouraged. Meaning you have opportunities to give input and be heard from time to time.

The bad:
Bonuses may vary wildly year-to-year, so don't count on those. Reviews can be a disappointment, even for hard working people, depending on the year and the manager because of the way Dell allots teams certain numbers of good and bad employee rankings regardless of actual team performance. Also there's no clear set of criteria you can meet to ensure advancement. Seems like it's mostly based on favoritism.

Advancement and moving between teams used to be encouraged. But the amount of time you must spend in-role increased from 6 months, 12 months, now all the way up to 18 months. And after 18 months, a current manager to veto your move for no strong reason- this has happened to several people I know.

Layoffs are extremely frequent- several times a year now. It causes employees stress and creates ""every man for himself"" environment where people feel compelled to steal each others' credit in an effort to prove they still have value.

The hardest workers tend not to get rewarded because Dell rewards politics over hard work.

No perks like free food/drinks or other cool stuff that's popular at other tech companies.

It's difficult to review an entire company when the company is so huge and diverse. It really depends on the team and manager. Some teams have terrible work/life balance, especially mission-critical teams, like IT. It's not uncommon to hear about 80-100 hour weeks and working through the weekends on those teams. On the other hand, some teams, like marketing, have excellent balance. Your schedule can be what you need it to be. It can be easy to get time off. The entire week of Christmas is a company holiday.

Also, some teams have a lot of redundancy. It can be easy on some teams to feel disconnected to anything valuable or to just feel like you're spinning your wheels. Other teams are very clearly connected to customer satisfaction and company goals, and it's easy to see how your daily work impacts the bigger picture.

Dell has its own culture. It emphasizes the ability to move around from one position to another. It provides a lot of great opportunities to do completely different things while remaining at the same company and location. It's not hard to find yourself in a position and with responsibilities that you could not have found elsewhere. It can really help to build experiences and skills. The downside of that is that the organization is constantly in flux. It can be hard to figure out who owns what at any given time. It's easy to repeat mistakes because it's difficult to maintain institutional learnings. Picking up a new role can feel like starting from scratch.

EMC is a very hardworking company that expects you to work hard for as long as it takes. Your rewards will be determined by your business unit, but there will be no space for work/life balance.

Everything at EMC revolves around putting in 200% everyday without adequite resources, and combatting poor direction & poor communication.

I left the company when I found that consistently 50% of my major projects each year where abandoned mid stream due to politics or poor direction from management.

As someone who thinks strategically, it was VERY hard to determine just what the company's goal was on a regular basis.

EMC's biggest challenge is that it fails to keep the company's infrastructure in pace with it's growth. There is a lot of the ""slap it together & we'll fix it later"" mentality. Quality was often a non-issue when compared to a deadline, even for internal products that were not customer facing.

Don't get me wrong, EMC paid me HANDSOMELY, but you should plan on changing business units every few years to avoid burnout if you choose to work there.

You should also make peace with the fact that you will spend a lot of time on dead end efforts that had no budget or strategy to begin with.Good pay, no work/life balance",0,1,4,0.0,1,3,0,0,1.0,1,1,1,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,0,0.0,1,2,0,3,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,1,0.16,0.749,0.09,0.0,1.0,0.0,-0.035

A typical day consisted of client meetings to catch up on progress within the field, studying financials and trends, then catching up with team members to discuss client feedback and areas of opportunities based on defined metrics and KPI's. Then we would discuss their obstacles and decide how we would proceed with tasks at hand.

The hardest part of the job was getting certain leaders within our client's organizations to understand the external marketplace factors that would alter deliverables. Even with trends data, analytics, historical business reviews, and reporting - some folks never got it. It wasn't a surprise that those same divisions were the thorn in their organization's side.

The work environment was relaxed and friendly, and thereby conducive to creativity and professional work ethics, which everyone I worked with exhibited. The manager was just ""one of the guys"", and he treated everyone with respect, played ping pong with us during lunch, and was always responsive and sensitive to everyone's personal needs. In return he got a team dedicated to their work, but more importantly a team that respected him and made sure that every project was completed on time and under budget. I learned much from him, but most importantly I remember that he said that ""a manager only looks as good as the people he manages make him look"".

From where I sat (in Services delivery organization), management squeezed every last penny possible out of our Small & Medium business contracts; I was asked to slash budgets year upon year, even when efficiencies were no longer possible. The result of this was increased outages, missed SLAs, unhappy clients and lost contracts. Very sad to see IBM slip from an experienced, capable services giant to a frail behemoth.

The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people who are universally interested in learning and applying knowledge to an overall task that's pretty hard to argue with - getting people good jobs.Great place",0,5,5,1.0,0,5,0,0,0.0,0,0,5,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0,1,0.051,0.738,0.212,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.5805

When I first started, I had a genuine love for Indeed's mission and I believed that our company had its employees/clients/job seekers best interests at heart. For example, the work/life balance at Indeed is great, and there's healthcare coverage! The maternity leave here is awesome, and there are some outreach efforts to impact our surrounding community. There is also a portal dedicated to internal mobility-- but the reality of internal growth opportunities is less promising than presented.


If you're not in one of the main office branches, you can't expect any personal development or career openings for further growth. Additionally, you may have a Manager/Director who will tell you that your feedback is valuable, but will in turn negate any feedback you share; no matter how tactfully you’ve presented it. In some instances, feedback given has been used to negatively impact employees during quarterly reviews. This kind of gaslighting is disappointing, but it's what you can expect if you plan to work in the San Mateo office.

Further, there is blatant favoritism amongst Managers/Directors, even to the point of promoting less experienced Indeed employees to senior positions. Given how political the office culture is, it's starting to resemble high school as opposed to a professional working environment. Managers will often be involved in conversations that are inappropriate for a workplace, and given the corporate structure, there is little that canGrowth Opportunities Lacking & Poor Office Morale-- But There are Snacks!",0,1,1,1.0,1,1,0,0,1.0,0,0,1,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,0,0.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0,1,0.048,0.798,0.154,1.0,0.0,0.0,-0.447

I really enjoyed my colleagues, they were all really great people to work along side.(Please note, almost 50% of CS San Mateo has left Indeed within the last 3 months, this turnover should be telling)

Many snacks, free food for breakfast daily and for lunch once a week. Wii U in the office, Mario Kart.

Depending on where you are coming from, Indeed can be a great place to build your skill set. If you hone in on certain aspects of the role, you will become much more marketable in the Bay Area after working for Indeed.

Convenient location right off of 101 and 92.

Cons:

Favoritism is the biggest issue the San Mateo office has. Certain people get more support and resources then others. This is fine sometimes, but everyday it gets old quick. It really depletes from the culture, and when the wrong people are promoted, it looks like this favoritism is actually driving the direction of the company culture.

Indeed says its a company interested in feedback from employees, but this is not actually the case. Expect gas lighting, and expect to be a ""yes man"" and nothing else. Not only will your feedback go unheard, it can often count against you later. General processes are also ill communicated between management and teams.

There is almost no advancement within the San Mateo office because there are only two departments that sit there. While Indeed will tell you that it cares about your career and your advancement within the company, I have seen a very small percentage move up internally.

For new sales people considering, recruiters are experts in sales and can sniff out a rehearsed pitch in 10 seconds and are filled with objections. For experienced sales people, this vertical is micro managed to an extreme which means if you don't fall in line it is difficult to move your career past a call center. To make things more difficult for Staffing AEs there are minimum sizes to the deals which you can close. Your minimums are double what your counterparts on the direct employer side can close. So not only are the clients more difficult to close, your budgets are also twice as limiting as your colleagues. This means deals are more difficult to come by and less commission dollars. There is no monetary compensation for your restrictions, only pride that you're working in the most difficult vertical.

When done properly there is a higher retention rate however this takes time to learn and in sales time is money. Middle management is fantastic, the AEs in staffing are incredible unique individuals.

Not to mention competitive benefit programs, an ongoing training curriculum and career path assistance.

Additionally, the tools and reporting capabilities from our product team are second to none. The sales team is given excellent support from IT, Client Services, etc. I am continually impressed with the thought and care that goes into the materials that are rolled out both internally and to our clients.

With the recent addition of top-notch marketing leadership, I look forward to Indeed becoming a household name in the very near future. We've already come a long way very quickly!

With our worldwide growth, I do not know all my fellow employees as well as I did during Indeed's infancy. However, there are many who have been here for a long time and are very proud of the Indeed product and the strong relationships they have established with their co-workers. I know I am not alone in my excitement for what's to come at Indeed...

Many of the positions at Intel are multifaceted allowing one to comprehend both the major directions and technical details of the business. The business model is also sustainable given the fact that near term profits are integrated to funding new technology development keeping the company 5-7years ahead of the nearest competition. Such detail, along with technical uncertainty in new technologies, and pressing business needs makes for a very stressful environment.

Every day was a challenge to keep up with a constant work load. I learned what I was capable of doing when faced with a lot of responsibilities. Management challenged me to be my best. The workplace culture was one that I was able to connect with. I liked the concept of getting things done and being rewarded for it. The hardest part of the job was not to over commit myself with the amount of work I had to do. I learned early in my career that it was better to give realistic completion dates and meet them rather than telling people I could get something done quickly and missing a deadline. My most enjoyable part of the job was a feeling of satisfaction completing the goals I had set.Intel was a great place to work.,0,5,5,1.0,0,5,0,0,1.0,0,0,5,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0,1,0.032,0.73,0.237,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.6025

However, the culture at Intel and the annual review process can be pretty harrowing (read: not fair). You can actually do your very best work and your review will sometimes be a roll of the dice--again, depending on the all-powerful manager. Having been a manager there, I know what I'm talking about with crystal clarity.

Intel's culture is old-school and so evening and weekend work is typical. Teams can feel the stress of pushing and pushing until a project is completed and for management to reassess is not an option. Their own job is on the line concerning meeting release dates.

The culture is also very competitive. You may develop great relationships there, but when you don't know someone too well yet, take care that you aren't dealing with someone who is collecting information to use for his benefit and use against you. Although this is usually not the case, it has happened to me from time to time. Just be careful about what you reveal to others.

As for interesting and leading-edge work--Intel's got it. Intel is involved in cutting edge technology and there are only a handful of big companies that have the breadth and depth that Intel has for a huge variety of technology development projects.

The compensation and benefits are pretty good though better can be had. Indeed, one may feel bound by the infamous ""golden handcuffs"" and always be hesitant to leave the company because of this.

Cons:
In Q2 of 2016 Intel cut 12% of workforce and all groups are struggling to get work done. Layoff was mishandled badly - primary method was to give workers a successful rating but no stock award. Hard to take getting laid off when you're successful especially since 70% of all employees receive a successful rating (per their rating distribution, that's required).

Will likely be overly competitive for a couple of years. 70% of employees are rated successful but to avoid most recent round of layoffs, you must be above that for last 3 years - which is statistically unlikely. Top heavy management. Company doesn't have a clear vision for growth and will cannibalize the workforce in an effort to grow.

The official word is that I didn't do enough my last couple of years to show personal growth in my job; not demonstrate enough of an interest to learn other things. The reality is that there simply wasn't anywhere else for me to go in my job, short of becoming a manager or leaving for another department. I'm in communications. What do I do next -- become an engineer?

Intel's big on ""personal growth."" They don't like it if you stay in one job too long; they'd rather have you move on to a different area after a few years. In theory, this creates a well-rounded employee. In practice, if forces you out of what you do best and into a role that you may not be suited for, which can lead to -- you guessed it -- subpar performance and loss of job. The company's executives face the same situation; there's been three different CIOs since 2008; our department had four managers in six years. You end up with a supervisor who isn't consistently trained, doesn't know all facets of their job (and who may have become a supervisor simply to show that crucial ""growth"") and makes mistakes that harm others' careers.

As a result, there's a lot of stress beneath the smiles people give as you walk down the hall.

And then there's company performance as a whole. Intel has had several boom and bust periods over the past 15 years, and when things are good, everybody's thrilled.

Some meetings can be early in the morning or late in the day/evening depending on who the attendees are and where they are physically located at. Management is great and encourages thinking outside of the box and risk taking. Teams and co-workers are great in that everyone is supportive and helpful and respectful. The hardest part of the job is saying good-bye to a fellow co-worker when they leave a team or the company as we have all evolved into an extended family.

The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction and learning about new cultures whether it is virtually or via International travel. For a company that employs +/- 100K workers around the world, it is wonderful to know that Intel is a place where ""everyone knows your name"". Other perks Intel provides are a full cafeteria with free beverages and fruits, which includes a breakfast menu until 10:00am and then Lunch from 11:00am to 2:00pm. They also provide an on-site medical clinic for both employees and their families, a gym, a putting green, a basketball court, a bank, and many other concierge services.

When new employees join Intel everyone goes through a set of mandatory courses which helps them to integrate into the Intel ‘way of life’ and gives them an introduction to our culture.

A typical workday involves sorting hundreds of pieces of mail from various company locations from Sacramento to San Diego; some days are super busy and other days are slow.

As an employee for over a decade, I've learned many things such as, conflicts can be and are healthy, management at every level should be open to ideas from their employees, different employee backgrounds are beneficial because they bring will about fresh viewpoints and ideas, the organization values those who driven and goal-oriented, and people must be able to adapt to change because the organization is continually evolving.

Management can either be encouraging or difficult to deal with, depending on the person who's in charge. Every manager has a unique approach to handling various situations and problems that may arise. A good manager will cause their employees to always want to go the extra mile for them. I've had some managers who made me want to go to work, and some who made me dread going to work.

My company's workplace culture is among the most diverse in the U.S. Kaiser employs individuals from many different races, gender, ethnic backgrounds, cultural beliefs, religion, and political affiliation.

Daily, edicts are handed down with new rules which are enforced in a draconian manner. Every call you receive is recorded and you are encouraged as a new advice triage nurse to ask your charge for assistance or advice. When you do, and execute that exact instruction, you can be written up if it veers at all from the ""manual.""

I learned that it takes a village to make a healthcare organization run smoothly, with different departments being able to communicate with each other and utilize all of their skills and abilities in a way that everyone benefitted from.

The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the different staff there and see how much they really cared about the patients.

It is still a great place to work with respect to learning about, and implementing, new technology. They also provide many opportunities to get involved in side-projects to expand your exposure to new technology. There is also AMPLE opportunity to get career and technical mentoring there.

They still have the **BEST** employee benefits compared to anywhere in the US. I would still recommend MSFT to college graduates looking for initial technical skill development so they can move on to something else. Compensation has never been stellar at MSFT - but its good enough. Work/Life balance has improved greatly since the 90's.

However, I would no longer recommend it as a place to climb the ladder or get job advancement. MSFT has taken more to hiring people from the outside, and preserving their middle-management 'in-crowd' by continually providing lateral transfers to that group in order to maintain the careers of the anointed few. They have also implemented regional hiring practices to the detriment of many.

Now this is just the tip of the iceberg. The training that you receive is just on how to ""sell"" the rest of the product training and tools is done by yourself, which is not bad and now a days is normal, however, every time I needed something from her (my manager) , I asked her, and her answer was just "" I don't know"", "" Do it on your own"", "" Find out, that's why Microsoft pays you for...' and some other sweet answers you could from someone who was suppost to be you ""LEADER"" and not just a manager. Anyone can be a boss, but not everyone can be a good Leader.

The environment within the team, was so heavy, that every meeting with her, was like if you were about to receive the worst news of your life, it was just horrifying.

The worst experience I had on the team was with a particular person who was very unprofessional by saying aggressive and simply untrue things about me in meetings, and only when I wasn't around. Without going into detail, Microsoft is a company that allows this kind of conduct, without consequence or repercussion. I professionally tried to resolve the matter personally with the person, but I was essentially 'put back in my place.'

However the best project I worked on was when I saw a project that needed some TLC, so I talked to my manager's manager and told him what I saw and how I believed I could contribute, and he gave me a significant role on the project; however, temporarily. In this project I was a true, contributing member of the team—attending meetings, making informed design decisions—and my word was trusted and valued. All-around I was seen as a top-performer and integral part of the project. Even after the product shipped I was told the product wouldn't have been what it was without me.

When I was taken off the project by my manager, I was back on the same grind where my skills were nowhere near close to being utilized to my potential.

In the following months, sometimes there would be days...weeks...on end where I would interface with no one. My manager was absent 90% of the time, and he'd check in with me only about once every month.

Re: Compensation/Benefits
You make quite a bit, but you won't be able to afford a house on single income within 15 miles of HQ in Redmond which means you're renting or buying a house and commuting for an hour each way. The benefits are not on par with other tech companies of their foot print. Their cafeteria food is also sub-par and significantly overpriced.

In Support/Operations, advancement is rare but secure for the most part. Everyone is checked out, so don't expect much validation.

There are literally a hundred directions you can take your career in, but the programs to promote career paths are murky at best. If you are fresh out of college, you'll be hand-held to success. If you are older, you're on your own. Equal opportunity employer with very diverse teams, and while nice to see, there are the typical stereo-type roles we all seem to play there in the end.
The most positive aspect of my day is that I can find a job that fits my personal life-style, meaning I have a flexible schedule. This does limit my choices for advancement of course, but it's a welcome compromise. Also, Microsoft is loaded with incredibly intelligent people, which makes work fun and challenging. I do not find myself questioning my manager's decision-making skills, which is nice.
On the frustrating side is the politics, and if you don't play it's tough to move ahead. Job security is also a major downer as teams come and go every 6 months when upper management decides to start up a new team to create visibility to their managers.
Best way to look at Microsoft and IT as a whole - take care of your own business, always have a positive attitude, don't burn bridges, be a great team player and have a great brand to stand on, seek to learn new things and offer to take on new projects and make those around you better.Predictable uncertainty",0,5,5,0.0,0,4,0,0,0.0,0,0,3,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,1,0.0,0,4,0,2,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,0.0,1,0.026,0.665,0.31,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.392

We provide what the company designs and makes and our job is to teach them to understand it, use it, and make the purchasing experience as painless and efficient as possible.

Every day, we'd have a meeting about our goals for the day, events, coworker camaraderie, but never sales first. Our financial goals came at the end of the meeting so that the vast majority of the meeting was spent talking about new tech, our coworkers, the new experiences we might give customers, and any new stock that might cater towards a certain customer.

If you are entrepreneurial, this is a spirit that jives with the future direction of the company but current engineering culture is still figuring out how to embrace this spirit given the need to maintain and bring forward legacy products and processes. Microsoft is a work in progress, yet again.

A day in the life depends on what your role is, and many of us wear many hats. Expect to exchange opinions and take feedback, sometimes harshly delivered, on a regular basis. When you work on something important, which is most everything, there are always others who care deeply about getting it right and getting it out on time.

If you are lucky enough to interact with customers on a regular basis, expect to spend time trying to get their voices heard. This is more and more a value in the company and everyone will spend time on forums like UserVoice, Reddit, and other forums for direct customer and partner contact.

Some degree of politics and many layers of management in this huge company still make it hard to move and respond quickly even though there is a strong push towards One Microsoft.

All that was required was a fundamental curiosity and desire to figure out how to turn a mountain of data into useful information for the problem at hand.
Sadly a lot more intelligence went into figuring out how to game the compensation/review process. The results being a management style that rewarded never taking a risk and in those cases where risk was inherent to the project, make sure there were 'mitigating circumstances' or someone else to blame in the event of failure.
The biggest inflection points for Microsoft were when stock options were removed from the rank and file employees compensation. Then the DOJ and EU trials. Bill leaving the management to Steve was another change that reinforced a risk adverse corporate culture.

There is international contact even for positions that are domestic in nature. Provides opportunity to work with and learn from colleagues in other regions (Europe, Asia, Latin America, etc.).

Great benefits (variety of free drinks and some snacks). Many jobs allow for flexibility to work remotely (e.g. from home, remote offices, etc.). Much is expected of the employees including long days and sometimes weekends. Co-workers (mostly) great to work with. They are driven yet easy to get along with. One tough situation is that performance is not only measured against objectives, but against your colleagues. At yearly review time, it creates a bit of a tense environment, but it's manageable.
Management: in a 100,000 employee and approximately 30-40,000 contractors, the talent varies. The process for establishing performance objectives is very well established so ""self-management"" is very important. In addition, there are constant re-organizations so that could be distracting. There is a constant effort to minimize bureaucracy given the size of the company.
Lots of virtual team work with regular progress reviews. Weekly for run operations and core teams, monthly and quarterly with management. A lot of interdependence with other groups so cross group collaboration is a must.

Learned a great deal technically as well as how to deal with different people and teams with varying goals, technical knowledge and personalities.

In my tenure at Microsoft, I've had some great managers who have strived to do the best for the customers and also for the team. They completely trusted my skills in all my projects and stood behind me when I needed any support. Have also experienced the flip side where the manager had their own agenda with little regard for customer needs or team morale. Needless to say, it was very rewarding and satisfying to work with the first set of managers.

In general, co-workers were very nice to work with. In some teams, depending on the culture being driven by management, there wasn't much cooperation and collaboration among devs and PMs. But most times, co-workers were willing to work towards a common goal and help each other out.

Hardest part of the job was not being able to release a feature due to clashing goals and personalities in the org.

Gaining and losing advancement opportunities became personal. If anyone complained about a favored person or procedure, suddenly they were gone and ""no longer a social fit for the company"". They used harsh critique and peer pressure, warped the rules to keep or cut employees. Perks were slowly being removed and policies were being changed so often we couldn't keep up.

The ""inverted pyramid"", in my opinion, has changed and there is much less a ""promote from within"" mentality than existed previously, which I believe is a result of the new Amazon culture moving into the corporate atmosphere in Seattle. It was somewhat of an open secret that in order to get more competitive pay leaving the company then returning was the way to achieve that goal.

All in all, the culture and community at Nordstrom is what made me stay as long as I did. I was once in a presentation where it was explained to us that some companies had more people, and some had better people, but that we had ""more better"" people - and frankly I agree!

TYPICAL WORK DAY:
Start btw 6am and 7am and work till 3 or 4pm
You have to update mannequins and displays in a rotating schedule, or you could be re-arranging a departments floor racks to better promote brands and trends. Throughout the the day you are helping sales remove items from mannequins for customer requests and updating trim or window displays.

HARDEST PART OF JOB:
Learning on your feet and learning the method in which things are done. All the holiday decorations came with installation packets that are not hard to figure out but can be overwhelming at first because of the amount of decor. The holiday person is responsible for getting all decor out of storage and ready for install night. (The eve of Thanksgiving) Your every day is spent fluffing christmas trees, hanging ornaments and prepping for install night.
Install night was the most stressful my job ever got (but still was not too bad because I had a great team) Its an overnight shift where volunteers and the Visual Team work from 8pm till it's done. Then the following week a regional manager will come and inspect the decor. I felt like an Elf making Christmas happen.
Once decor is up, the Holiday Visual will keep the decor looking nice and have a more hands on with actual fashion and visual merchandising.

Your flexibility is a must to these stores, they will want you as early as 6 in the morning and as late as 2 in the morning. However, that does not extend to you getting to be as flexible as you will want to be, especially if you would like to keep the benefits Nordstrom Rack carries. On average you will need to be working 32 hours weekly in order to maintain benefits, yet in the time I spent working, this is much easier said than done. As a full time associate there would be weeks I worked well under the 30 hour mark off-season, while still having to work 5 days a week, it can end up becoming very inconsistent. Managers can also be very inconsistent, especially in terms of communication with each other and the employees. Often putting schedules out with shifts given outside of your availability, or one handling certain store procedures in a wildly different manner than another. Good luck trying to be promoted from within either, they will pull someone from the Full Line Nordstrom inexperienced with the Rack culture before they will bring someone already possessing leadership skills up to the position. The best part of the day is really the other coworkers you will be spending your time with, as they make the time go by that much quicker.

What I saw was a customer friendly company that will give you a promotion if you are drinking buddies with the right manager or have been a top seller for decades. Retail is a dying industry and that is felt no where more than on the floor of a Nordstrom store. Most of your day will be spent processing returns and taking on work that should be handled by management but isn't. Once promoted to management, since the positions are so competitive, upper managers of a store are very relaxed in their roles, seldom responding to the day to day needs of a store. The store manager is often out of touch with what is going on in their own store, this creates an air of chaos and bickering amongst coworkers. Sales staff fight amongst themselves and across departments as everyone is starved for commission. Sales are low and the Nordstrom family and their partners have chosen to continuously undercut their staff by minimizing opportunities for sales staff to make commission thus exacerbating the issue of pay.Stressful Work Environment",0,2,3,0.0,0,2,0,0,1.0,1,0,2,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,1,0.0,1,3,0,3,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0,1,0.097,0.809,0.093,0.5,0.5,0.0,-0.252

The most difficult part of the job comes from declining foot traffic in store. At a time when the customer can order from home and receive free shipping, fewer and fewer customers actually visit the store. There is immense pressure to call customers to restock their items previously purchased in order to make sales goals. The job is becoming more about telemarketing than face-to-face customer service. Declining in store sales make it difficult for the employees when the motto is ""the more you sell, the more you make."" Fewer sales mean less commission and less hours during each pay period because management will send employees home early on slow days.

Management is completely aloof to how to run anything, and it has allowed a variety of horrible managers to get into positions of power and destroy things for its employees, causing several on the team I was on to outright quit. The slogan of Nordstrom, Nice is at most a farce, as the reality is that most people there are incredibly vain and skin deep. They're the kind of preppy people everyone hated in high school - nice to your face but then go behind your back and say all sorts of nasty things about you. They try to say they are all about diversity, but they haven't a clue on how to even handle diversity - the number of times I've heard other employees make sexist, racist, homophobic, and transphobic statements is insane, and turning to HR for help made it apparent that they would be shielded from criticism. In fact, turning to HR actually made matters worse, because the people doing these nasty things were only emboldened in their animosity to anyone who stood up to their problematic opinions and behaviors - the managers especially. Their policy of Use Good Judgment is a catch-all phrase that means nothing more than whatever your manager thinks it means, and is only ever used to tear people down for doing something someone above didn't like.

I enjoyed working in sales there because of the wide variety of interesting customers, and I loved my coworkers and manager - they made it fun to show up to work every day. Working in sales at Nordstrom involves being on your feet constantly, and can be physically exhausting due to the many mandatory tasks other than selling such as restocking, cleaning, rearranging displays, answering phones (often customer service related,) and, of course, doing returns. There is no time to stand around idle, but if you work hard, make sales your priority, have a good rapport with customers so as to develop a good personal clientele, and don't get too many returns against you, it is possible to earn anywhere from $15.00 to $30.00+ per hour.. Yes, the returns get frustrating because you are working on a commission basis - especially if it is one of your own customers. It's hard to lose the commission on a good sale that you invested a lot of time and effort in, but you have to just smile and try to look forward and hope you can make it up on a new sale. During the years I worked there I witnessed almost every salesperson break down in tears at one time or another when they found out about returns against them (hard to pay rent when you don't make money) and promised I would never let it get to me like that ... but it does. So be prepared for some major letdowns due to the notorious company return policy.. but Nordstrom is a well run company with great benefits and good career opportunities.Work at Nordstrom",1,4,5,1.0,0,5,0,0,1.0,1,0,4,0.0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,5,0,4,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,0.0,1,0.07,0.741,0.188,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.5589999999999999

The relationships you get to create with your customers and the service you can offer is truely remarkable. Also the people that work for the company are the best thing that you can hope for in a job. They really are like a family and that is what keeps most employees there at least in my experience. The tricky part about working for this company is that Nordstrom gives its employees and managers the freedom to ""use your best judgment"" reguarding any difficult situation that you come across. That being said, the company gives alot of freedom to management to decide what they think is ok and whats crossing a line so every single manager has a different idea of how things should be. this can make working for managers there incredibly difficult. And because Nordstrom has such an entrepenure spirit about it, there are a ton of bias involved in who moves up and who gets demoted/fired in the company. You can be a top seller and work for the company for years but one day if a manger decides they don't like you anymore they can find a reason to fire you or keep you in your spot so you cant move up and thats it. I've seen it happen numerious times. and HR does nothing to help support the employees, they are there to protect the company that is all. So you have to walk on eggshells pretty often because if you end up getting a power trippy manager or vengeful one you'll be stuck in the same place or out of the job pretty quick.Customer service is like nothing else",0,2,4,0.0,1,3,0,0,0.0,1,0,2,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,1,4,0,3,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,0.0,1,0.053,0.822,0.125,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.036000000000000004

Typically, my day would start with putting out new merchandise which arrived daily. Many times I would call customers I had a rapport with, if I felt that something arrived that was a ""must have"". I would do the details of the day, which, included getting alterations and calling those customers. Making sure the department had the tools necessary--bags, register tape, garment bags, etc. I was considered by many to be reliable and dependable by management and was not given a lot of supervision.

As it was a commission based environment, I did find that one of my initial weaknesses was not being as competitive as I should have been, I tended to acquiesce to the bolder sales associate, however, I did have a wonderful supervisor who insisted I be strong to stand for what was mine.

I really enjoyed working with the customers that I met in the Women's clothing department. By listening to their needs and desires I was able to help them choose the items they needed for their specific occasion. By asking the right questions, and assessing the size and shape, I could make their experience very rewarding.

Working on the sales floor and in a support role I had the opportunity to see both sides of the coin. The customer service that Nordstrom teaches and emphasizes is a great tool. The level of professionalism working in the customer service department was something i really enjoyed as well as dealing with the daily problem solving and responsibilities I was given. It was also a nice steady pay which was great. Working on the sales floor was a different beast entirely. The nice part is your have the ability to control what you make and your pay check by how hard you work but the other side of that is that your pay is a roller coaster. Working on the floor your have to factor in returns on a daily basis, competition with other associates, your ranking on the schedule which determines your hours, and the time of year it is which has a direct effect on how high sales are. They say that if your have personals and appointments you can increase your sales even in slow times or when you don't have any hours but realistically its very difficult to create your own business unless you've been there quite some time. One pay check you can make 600 dollars and work 30 hours total and the next work 70 hours and make 2,000 dollars. So the stability of the sales floor is not something I would recommend to most.

The pay was decent for retail, the scheduling was flexible and almost everyone was polite and friendly. The managers also seemed to be on the right page when it came to procedures and policies. I honestly don't have any real complaints except the fact that because it was commission based, depending on your rate and whether you got an hourly plus commission, the environment could be very aggressive. I worked in the fine jewelry and watch department and our pay was straight commission so the environment was often very harsh and competitive. I usually referred to it as a ""shark tank."" That was honestly the worst part about working there because since it was sole commission, you truly see the greed and selfishness come out in people. Making sales also became a huge challenge after the holiday season which greatly makes a difference in your pay. That was another challenging aspect of working at Nordstrom.

Now even this project is threatened to be cancelled and there are chances we get laid off. Unfortunately all of this is due to poor vision from upper management while all engineers did an excellent job and delivered a fine product that was as requested from the management.

Overall, I would say that it's a good company to build and advance your career. The company has excellent pay and benefits once you've gotten to a senior level position.

The sales side of the company is extremely competitive and tends to lean more on the unethical and questionable side. You'll spend more time competing with other sales teams for Oracle products than actually competing with external forces. The comp structure on the sales side is crazy, but don't don't expect a solid base pay. Currently there is excessive pressure to push cloud services and cloud credits on customers. If you fight for your customer's best interests, you may get into trouble, so be careful.

The consulting side of the company is extremely understaffed, under trained, and stretched very thin. The higher up you climb in the consulting side, you more customers and products you'll have to cover. You'll spend most of your time either in pre-sales consulting support or post-sales janitor duty. A lot of consulting gigs at Oracle are horribly mismanaged and at the behest of the sales team to clean up after their poor judgement on solution positioning or on the customers dime to fix their mistakes.

The software development side can be challenging or fun, depending on which products you work on.

Oracle Direct only promotes within sales though; it's really hard to make a lateral move within the company.

I find the culture of the company to be rather negative at first, as if the culture of the company was to hate the company. It creates camaraderie among employees in a weird way though.

For professional sales people, the best way to get into the company would be through a referral.

I find that there is a fairly high turnover rate, but that's often people leaving for higher pay and they come back later on.

Local management does a great job in shielding from the top level politics and does indeed support its direct reports.
It is an ever changing environment that presents challenges and opportunities. Since Oracle's customers are usually consulting organizations, many of the issues are pushing the end of the envelope of technical feasibility which is challenging to come up with solutions and alternatives. Day to day work as a support analyst requires a discipline to check email (to see if there are any internal process changes, etc.), log into the applications necessary to perform the support function. Researching issues automatically assigned to the analyst will likely involve the need to reproduce the issue on internal servers or log into the customer servers to examine the results and drill back through the data to identify root cause.

I was asked to join ""the team"" in person, but Oracle wouldn't allow for moving expenses, time to move, an increase in pay to cover owning a house on the east coast and renting a shoebox on the west coast, or give me more than two weeks to find someone to rent my house as selling it that quickly was impossible.

I wasn't allowed to complete projects that hadn't been finished before the acquisition, I had to do that on my own time.

Bonuses and raises that were agreed upon before the acquisition were denied under the new management.

ZIllow has a great culture and is full of amazing and intelligent people. If you want to work in a tech job with great work/life balance, amazing benefits, while surrounded by smart people, you should work at Zillow.

Hardest Part: The technical challenges. I think this should be the hardest part, because you aren't learning anything otherwise.

Most Enjoyable: Free lunches, co-workers, solving challenging problems.
